Only made me love you more

And I'll write the words you love
And what I can't say in a letter

Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you

leader of the band,dan fogelberg,1982," An only child alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant
For different work And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone
And solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls Took me years to understand
The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument And his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy To the leader of the band
My brothers' lives were different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago And the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose And come to know so well
I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom When it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, papa, I don't think I said 'I love you' near enough

And his eyes are growing old

And his song is in my soul

Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved

empty garden hey hey johnny,elton john,1982," What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear
Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name
And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play
And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out,
Can't your come out to play, in the empty garden, Johnny. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden"

Now I know my love for her goes on I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
Ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone Every little thing she does is magic

Only you can fill that space inside So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own

man on your mind,little river band,1982," I can feel it floating away

Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea I can feel it coming adrift

From an ocean liner to a Chinese junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk I used to dream it could last forever
But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you I said, ""Baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders""
How you ever gonna find the words to say, ""Goodbye"" You don't know just what you got till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot but it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name It's not something you can hide away

It's written on your face you've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know I said, ""Baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders""
How you ever gonna find the words to say, ""Goodbye"" It's already fallen
So it's no use to fight
And if he starts callin'
Let him know you're with me

Tryin' their best to survive

Is a dying romance

billie jean,michael jackson,1983," She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
Of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round People always told me ""be careful of what you do""
""And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
And mother always told me ""be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"" Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice She told ""my baby, that's a threat""
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
Eyes were like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

No, she is not just my baby
But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one Billie Jean is not my lover

maneater,daryl hall  john oates,1983,
maniac,michael sembello,1983," Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before (crazy! crazy! crazy! crazy!) On the ice-blue line of insanity is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery: touch it, but can't hold it.
You work all your life for that moment in time, it could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night There's a cold kinetic heat, struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her head against the wind She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like she's never danced before
It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know (I sure know)

africa,toto,1983," I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12: 30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

allentown,billy joel,1983," Well we're living here in allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line
Well our fathers fought the second world war
Spent their weekends on the jersey shore
Met our mothers in the uso
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay
Well we're waiting here in allentown
For the pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke
And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in allentown
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away
Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an american flag in our face
Well I'm living here in allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today
And it's getting very hard to stay
And we're living here in allentown"

First he took my hand... take me home Stand back... stand back

Don't want to see you let a good thing

But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go

Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means Listen boy

To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it

You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it

To wait--you got to

How you play my emotions

May be my treasure or the price I have to pay.

May be the chill that autumn brings.
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day. She
May be the beauty or the beast.
May be the famine or the feast.
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell.
She may be the mirror of my dreams.
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem Inside her shell She who always seems so happy in a crowd.
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry.
She may be the love that cannot hope to last May come to me from shadows of the past.
That I remember till the day I die She
May be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years
Me I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is

making love out of nothing at all,air supply,1983," I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it

Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright
I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you
I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

i wont hold you back,toto,1983," If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right

Time can't erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one instead You know I won't hold you back now

And I
Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you Only to find any dream that I follow
Is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you
And that cannot be reversed
You made the rules, and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me Out of my mind
I am held by the power
Of you, love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by Oh Why do you have to be a heartbreaker

Suddenly everything I ever wanted

I always end up complaining
When I've got myself to blame. You're just a dead giveaway
You'dthink I'd learn to handle this by now
You're just a dead giveaway. Girl you can't deny it You keep trying to hide it I get a call about 2am
Saying you don't want to be alone
Now I'm tired and half asleep
But emotions are just a little too strong. I figure that I'd call your bluff
Cause you want me to come on by
Girl you know it's your love I've always wanted
And this time I wont be denied. Cause you're a dead giveaway
Girl you want me like I want you
A dead giveaway. You're scared but you wont admit it But tonight you're committed
Cause you're just a dead giveaway. You're not that naive girl Is playing deciever
Well now that you're serious
It's time to take off that disguise
You want more that mental stimulation
I can see it in your eyes. For years I've been your analyst
I've been as patient as I've been kind
For years youve played off believing
That I loved you for only your mind. Cause you're a dead giveaway. I can tell by the look in your eye
That you're a dead giveaway. I'm finding out
What you're all about. You're just a dead giveaway."

They land at six o'clock and there we are, the dutiful
Eating from TV trays, tuned into happy days
Waiting for world war three while Jesus slaves To the mating calls

whats love got to do with it,tina turner,1984," You must understand
Though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I read it some place
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken I've been taking on a new direction
And I have to say
I've been thinking 'bout my own protection
It scares me to feel this way What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken What's love got to do, got to do with it

missing you,john waite,1984," Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone Away
I ain't missing you No matter What I might say There's a message
In the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you

I've been listening to your dreams and getting very low
Wondering what I can do Maybe I'm being foolish
cause I haven't heard you mention anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie You've been talking in your sleep
Sleepin' in your dreams
With some sweet lover
Holding on so tight
Lovin' her the way
You used to love me
Talkin' in your sleep with lovin' on your mind. Repeat verse 2

lets go crazy,prince and the revolution,1984," Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called LIFE.
Electric word ""life""
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you, there's something else
The afterworld.
A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night.
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life, you're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She just picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Aah, aah!"" is all I heard I'm not gonna let de-elevator bring us down, oh no, let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go All excited, but don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause, we're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what's it all for)
Better live now
Before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door
Tell me baby,
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go Come on baby, let's get nuts!
Yeah, crazy Let's go crazy Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go Go Crazy
I said, let's go (crazy) Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Just what I'm asking it for

I bang the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Or can the people on TV see me
or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair
Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there!
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much

Is to be in love with a man She wants to lead a glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead a glamorous life
Without love, it ain't much She saw him standing in the section marked
If you have to ask, you can't afford a lingerie
She threw him bread and said make me scream
In the dark what could he say Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said, I need a man's man, baby, diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head She wants to lead a glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead a glamorous life
Without love, it ain't much They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 Secret Street
They made love and by the seventh wave
She knew she had a problem She thought real love is real scary
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever that's all your life
Love is heaven sent, it's glamorous Lead a glamorous life

So hard to see that a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed Oh leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
Cause this time little darlin' I'm coming home to stay I'm stuck on you
Got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you til' the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed"
i guess thats why they call it the blues,elton john,1984," Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me
I could honestly say
That things can only get better And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long
Before you and me run
To the place in our hearts
Where we hide And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second
Without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever
I simply love you
More than I love life itself And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever
I simply love you
More than I love life itself And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers

I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why I'm gonna try for an uptown girl

And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind She'll see I'm not so tough

And all her presents from her uptown boys

But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine She'll say I'm not so tough

And ironing out the rough spots

We can share the troubles we already know Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
and it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs

Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh

No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever

an innocent man,billy joel,1984," Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above
Making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Than to wait anymore I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I've not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me I'll understand Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision
But I'm not below
Anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die

nobody told me,john lennon,1984," Three, four! Everybody's talking and no one says a word
Everybody's making love and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China so finish what you got Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- strange days indeed Everybody's runnin' and no one makes a move
Everyone's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Katmandu Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in the movies you just gotta lay around Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's a UFO over New York and I ain't too surprised
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama, roll!"

But the computer has the evidence
No need to abort
the countdown starts,
watching in a trance
the crew is certain Nothing left to chance, all is working
Trying to relax, up in the capsule
""Send me up a drink"", jokes Major Tom The count goes on 4-3-2-1
Earth below us, drifting falling
Floating weightless, calling calling home Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit
stabilizers up, running perfect
starting to collect, requested data
what will it effect, when all is done
Thinks Major Tom Back at ground control, there is a problem
Go to rockets full, not responding
Hello Major Tom, are you receiving
turn the thrusters on, we're standing by There's no reply 4-3-2-1
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, calling, calling, home Across the stratosphere
A final message, ""Give my wife my love""
Then nothing more Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning
They don't realize, he's alive
No one understands but Major Tom sees
Now the life commands, this is my home I'm coming home Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, coming home Earth below us, drifting, falling

As the music dies something in your eyes

And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is that all you'll find

I know you're not a fool

I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever But now, who's gonna dance with me? Please stay I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm

Feels like the world upon my shoulders.
But through the clouds I see love shine -
It keeps me warm as life grows colder. In my life there's been heartache and pain;
I don't know if I can face it again.
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life... I wanna know what love is.
I want you to show me.
I wanna feel what love is.
I know you can show me. I'm gonna take a little time,
A little time to look around me.
I've got nowhere left to hide -
It looks like love has finally found me. In my life there's been heartache and pain;
I don't know if I can face it again.

everybody wants to rule the world,tears for fears,1985," Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never never need it
One headline why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world
All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts for ever
Everybody wants to rule the world"

cant fight this feeling,reo speedwagon,1985," I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship
Has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places
That alone I'd never find And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream

Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes

Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" when part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, its really you my part-time lover We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers"
saving all my love for you,whitney houston,1985," A few stolen moments, is all that we shared
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy, living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you
You used to tell me, we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get an old feeling, when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight, is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night
That I'm feeling all right
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you
For you"

The traffic roars the sirens scream
Look at the faces it's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still First crystal tears,
Fallen of snowflakes on your body
First time in years
To drench you skin of lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die But can we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire When all we see is the view to a kill"

Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best

I see your face everywhere

Who am I to blame you
For doubting what you feel I was always reachin'

Sunglasses on baby

I'm gonna show you what I'm made of I can see you

A little voice inside my head said:
""Don't look back, you can never look back""

What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but, I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down

Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those

But the city don't know what the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner Time flies - doesn't seem a minute
since the Tirolean spa had the chess boards in it
All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings
Or ... or this place! One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board
not looking at the city Whattaya mean?!
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town Tea, girls, warm and sweet, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite Get Thai'd, you're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine! One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
or reclining Buddha Thank God I'm only watching the game, controlling it I don't see you guys raging
The kind of mating I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you. So, you better go back to your bars, your temples ...
your ""massage parlors"" ... One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history

Not much between despair and ecstasy

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind

Forever, no Yeah And now the times are changing

I think about you, wonder what went wrong Standing on your mama's porch

fortress around your heart,sting,1985," Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers in beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no prize of pity
The siege guns had been pounding through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlement on fire Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought, or even wished that I was dead
While the armies all are sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I laid And if I've built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognised the fields where I'd once played
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mined I'd laid And if I've built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire"

Was a masquerade

Seems the hardest thing to do
Is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Someone who understands
That when you feel you lost your way
You've got someone there to say,
I'll show you [Chorus] So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world's got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believing who you are, you are a shining star [Chorus] Say it together, naturally"

I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy
(Can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
How will I know?

How will I know?

party all the time,eddie murphy,1986,
burning heart,survivor,1986," Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand
Is it east versus west
Or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?
In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
(In the burning heart)
In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries, never
Deep in our soul a quiet ember
Know it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone
In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
In the burning heart"

greatest love of all,whitney houston,1986," I believe the children are our future
Teach them well
And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty
They possess inside Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be Everybody's searching for a hero People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone
Who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me.
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I lived as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself It is the greatest love of all

Teach them well
And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty
They possess inside

Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning

When the mirror crashed i called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today

these dreams,heart,1986," Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over These dreams in the mist
Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
There's something out there
I can't resist I need to hide away, from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist
These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away"

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me I know where beauty lives

The light that you could never see
It shines inside you can't take that from me... A man can tell a thousand lies

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me... The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again? If I ran away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart...?
Will it grow cold?
(will it grow cold?)
The secret that I hide
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...? A man can tell a thousand lies

something about you,level 42,1986," Ooh...
Ooh...
How - how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate Could suffer so hard
From the games played much too often
But making mistakes is a part Of life's imperfections born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
Don't want to be without you
Baby tonight
Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby tonight Ooh...
Ooh...
And there's something about you
I couldn't live without you

These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
That's my funday
An I-don't-have-to-run day
It's just another manic Monday Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time 'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
When the bus is already there It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
An I-don't-have-to-run day
It's just another manic Monday All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun) It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
Ah I-don't-have-to-run day
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
It's just another manic Monday"

Something's on your mind 'Cause in your dreams
The demon screams
I know he's going to
Hurt you blind You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore If I was king for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you If I was king for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all
We need to get us through And diamond rings
And all those things
They never sparkle
Like your smile And as for fame
It's just a name
That only satisfies
You for a while You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore If I was king for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you If I was king for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all
We need to get us through I've heard it said
Or maybe read
Only money makes
The world go round But all the gold
Won't heal your soul
If your world should
Tumble to the ground You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore So listen
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah Love is all
Love is all

love will conquer all,lionel richie,1986," Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do Here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all Do you really want to know
Just how long will last
Will all of the bad times pass?
How can we make things right? Ooh and why
Why is the world so unkind?
We surely can find peace of mind
If we only see the light Can't we see that
Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do Whoa, here we stand
Trying not to fall
Oh, there's no need to worry
Love will conquer all Can somebody tell me why?
Why do our dreams go wrong?
Why can't we all belong?
Ooh, where did we start? Oh, and tell me when
When will we ever learn
There's nowhere else we can turn
The truth is in our hearts Here we are together
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa Sometimes the road
Gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pain's
Too much to bear Sometimes when life
Seems to unravel
That's the time, oh, to say
We're gonna make it anyway Can't we see that
Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all, is all that we can do Here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all"
a different corner,george michael,1986," I'd say love was a magical flame
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare 'Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear"
ill be over you,toto,1986," Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same There were the nights holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them
Someday I'll be over you As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating, someday I'll be over you
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating, someday I'll be over you

the lady in red,chris de burgh,1987," I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
Looking for a little romance
Give'em half a chance
I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind
The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
And I hardly know
this beauty by my side
I'll never forget
the way you look tonight I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
as I do tonight
The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
And I hardly know
this beauty by my side
I'll never forget
the way you look tonight
I never will forget

The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving

Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line

Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again Didn't we almost have it all

Loving you makes life worth living

Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you
We'll never lose it again
Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end Didn't we almost have it all

And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though i went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow i made it through the heartache
Yes i did. I escaped.
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (i know you did), kept my faith When the river was deep i didn't falter
When the mountain was high i still believed
When the valley was! ow it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me With an endless desire i kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment, no i don't looking hack
When i think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (i know you do), i just laugh When the river was deep i didn't fairer

somewhere out there,linda ronstadt and james ingram,1987," Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moon light
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby

land of confusion,genesis,1987," I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street. Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
Burning into the night. There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion. Ooh this is the world we live in
(Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given
(Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying
(Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in. Ooh Superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
Are losing control by the hour. This is the time
This is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion. This is the world we live in
(Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given
(Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying
(Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in. I remember long ago
Ooh when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright
All through the night
And the sound of your laughter
As I held you tight
So long ago I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know, we'll never keep. Too many men
There's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion. Now this is the world we live in

Wondering what I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice, and no one listening
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep So listen, listen to me
Ooh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go thru me
But I don't know why Ooh I know you're going, but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault

Pay attention
Are you listening
You're my favorite girl
Excuse me for the moment

On a mountain by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with Cupid

Just a way to tell you
That I'm so into you

And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove Erotic whispers
For the listener
The passion starts again
And the lollipops and everything
With the little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from Heaven
And the day the earth stood still Hang the sign up on the door

la isla bonita,madonna,1987," Como puede ser verdad Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert

All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last they went so fast Tropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be

The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby I want to be where the sun warms the sky

You can watch them go by
Beautiful faces no cares in this world

mandolin rain,bruce hornsby and the range,1987," The song came and went like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile, it would last for awhile
You don't know what you got till you lose it all again Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind, sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go A cool evening dance listening to the bluegrass band
Takes the chill from the air till they play the last song
I'll do my time, oh keeping you off my mind
But there's moments that I find, I'm not feeling so strong Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind, sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go Running down by the lake shore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away once again, again Whoa oh oh
Yeah, listen to
Do, do, do The boat's steaming in, I watch the side wheel spin
And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind, oh I knew all the time
That she'd go, but that's a choice I made long ago Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind, sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go, as she turns to go Listen to the, listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go

In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then Smokey sings, he sings (Would it be true to say) Luther croons
Sly's the original originator
James screams
Marvin was the only innovator
But nothing can compare
Nothing can compare
When Smokey sings When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
She threw back the ring
When Smokey sings

is this love,survivor,1987," I've heard talk of blind devotion
Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful till the bitter end Now I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring I need to prove to myself
This is more than a crush
Can you convince me
It's not just a physical rush Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough Now I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk
Can I take it to heart Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other
If the moment is right Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love I've tread those mean streets
Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands
All touch, no feeling
Just another one night stand I need to know that there's someone who cares
Could you be the angel to answer my prayers
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'

met a man with a message from the other side
couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
he said it's up to you
you can run or you can fight (ya that's right)
better leave it alone - in the heat of the night

there'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down

That we'll be back together someday Tonight I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness

You relieve my sadness As we move to embrace tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly
I can't believe this pain
It's driving me insane
Without your touch life will be lonely So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday Tonight I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
Tonight I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness

one more try,george michael,1988," I've had enough of danger
People on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
I think it's time
That you let me know...
So if you love me say you love me
But if you don't just let me go... 'Cause teacher
There are things
That I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you...
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy Whose teacher has told him goodbye goodbye goodbye When you were just a stranger and I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes telling me no...
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song
I know it's wrong
Just let me go...
And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you...
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy Whose teacher has told him goodbye goodbye goodbye So when you say that you need me That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong you're not that strong let me go
And teacher
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you...
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try..."

It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...
As I, turn up the collar on my
Favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on
The wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

And no message could have
Been any clearer
If they wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself
And then make a change
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed - out dream
(Washed - out dream)

The wind, ya' see
Cause they got no place to be

They died the day you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies

And found the future not so bright

Used to always know what to do

There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true.

I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart (without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around (turn around) And tell you so.
There was no reason

Just a foolish beat of my heart.

Break my heart, you slipped away

So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh? Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?

And if somebody loves you Won't they always love you?

And I know that you still care for me
Ooh... I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we had was so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?
Where do broken hearts go? Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you? I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know, oh
Where do broken... hearts go?
Can they find their way home? Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?

Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a hazy shade of winter Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned Carry a cup in your hand Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a hazy shade of winter Hang on to your hopes my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend That you can build them again Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me? Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a hazy shade of winter Look around

There's a patch of snow
On the ground Look around

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you
If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you
There ain't no mistaking
It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you"

Shattered in a thousand pieces

Why does she stay on my mind

And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears

The joy you brought us through the years And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion

I've been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Go deep in the woods down the low valley road"" While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road
Walk on, walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on alone Out in the hall they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said, ""She's gone to her sisters""
Everybody knew, what they were talking about While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road
Walk on, walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on the old valley road Standing like a stone on the old plantation

For every gain To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains I want one moment in time

When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny And in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

The very best I want it all
No time for less I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands
Give me one moment in time

When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny And in that one moment of time

Make it shine

kissing a fool,george michael,1988," You are far

Who scared you to death and from my heart

'Til you listen to your heart People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart from you

Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye...
But please don't take my heart... You are far
I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough
I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind
While I listen to my heart People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart And people
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
Ba da da ah ah ah But remember this
Every other kiss
That you ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you like I always do
There's something there
That can't compare with any other You are far
When I could have been your star

Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too

You must have been kissing a fool"

All I can do is sit and smile That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything

Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby

Say yeah, yeah, yeah The winter days, they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks One night, me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say, ""Do you remember when?"" That's when a sport was a sport

All right Say yeah, yeah, yeah

If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven Got a few kids of my own
And some days I still don't know what to do
I hope that they're not laughin' too loud

Why don't they just let me live (Why)
I don't need permission (I don't need permission)
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative What is this a bizzit that I can't have money in my pocket
And people not talk about me
This world is a trip, I don't know what's going on these days
Got this person over here talking about me, this person
Hey, listen, lemme tell you something

every rose has its thorn,poison,1989," We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart, inside
Was it somethin' I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right??
Tho' I tried not to hurt you
Tho' I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yea it does
I listen to our favorite song playin' on the radio
Hear the dj say love's a game of
Easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains.
I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd know what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways
Now I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, i guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn"

wind beneath my wings,bette midler,1989," Oh, oh, oh, oh It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high

You don't need to fuss, girl or boy
These feelings I get, I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I

The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away, nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams... Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why
But listen to your heart, before you tell him goodbye... And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been)
When love was wilder than the wind
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you

Own funny moods

the living years,mike  the mechanics,1989," Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilled conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defense Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K. Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

What's he like anyway?
Yo' man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man
You know I mean? No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of.
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me No moneyman can win my love

As I sink, diving down deep... deeper into your soul.
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of.

bust a move,young mc,1989," This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us.
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous,
Play hard to get, females get jealous.
OK smarty, go to a party,
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body.
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her,
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter. Next day's function, high class luncheon,
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'.
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin',
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'.
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove,
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move. (vocal scatting)
Just bust a move! You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition.
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
No fine girls, just ugly faces.
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation.
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope,
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope. New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!""
You run over there without a second to lose,
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move! If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. In the city, ladies look pretty.
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.
Tell a funny joke just to get some play,
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""no way.""
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin',
They want a man who brings home the bacon.
Got no money and you got no car,
Then you got no woman and there you are. Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic.
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man.
So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin',
Everything you have is yours and not stolen.
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove,
So don't just stand there, bust a move! If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Break it down for me fellas) (vocal scatting) Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry,
In five days from now he's gonna marry.
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can,
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man.
You say neato, check your libido,
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo.
The bride walks down just to start the wedding,
And there's one more girl you won't be getting.
So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'.
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'.
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back,
And now you're feelin really fine 'cause the girl is stacked.
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin',
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'.
Says she wants to dance to a different groove.
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move! If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Move it, boy) (vocal scatting)"
once bitten twice shy,great white,1989," Well, the times are gettin' hard for you little girl
I'm a-hummin' and a-strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels You didn't know what rock 'n' roll was
Until you met my drummer on a gray tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet You didn't know how rock 'n' roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half-way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye, she was giving what she got said My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby
My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby
My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messin' around
My best friend told me, you're the best lick in town You didn't know that rock 'n' roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet I said I said, my my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby
My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby
My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby I didn't know you had a rock 'n' roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark and you're gone My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby
My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby
My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, baby My my my, I'm once bitten twice shy, I'm so shy"

B-b-b-baby
Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last no-no What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey-hey-hey So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or not And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees To express himself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey-hey-hey So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Baby ready or not Express yourself
Respect yourself
Hey-hey (so if you want it right now)

soldier of love,donny osmond,1989," So you heard that I'm a rebel with a heart made of stone
I got a restless spirit that nobody can own
If a picture tells a story won't you listen to mine
I'm searching for the answer but it's so hard to find You'll see much deeper when you read between the lines
'Cause there's a fire burning in my eye Like a thief in the night who can't get enough
I am willing to fight 'cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough
It's a state of the heart, you're a soldier of love I'm willing to fight Love can be so heartless when you turn out the lights
A mutual surrender in the heat of the night
Life's an empty picture when you're living alone
And maybe that's the reason every heart needs a home Each time I fall down, I get on my feet again
I'm gonna win this battle in the end Like a thief in the night who can't get enough
I am willing to fight 'cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough
It's a state of the heart and you're a soldier of love You'll see much deeper when you read between the lines
'Cause there's a fire burning in my eye Like a thief in the night who can't get enough

funky cold medina,tone loc,1989," Alright, dig it Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action
But like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def, yo, what's up with L O C? The girls is all jockin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina"" This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina You know what I'm sayin'?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,"" I said, ""Ehm okay, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies
Ya know? Break it down Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on, The Love Connection
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin'
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina Ya, know what I'm sayin'
That Medina's a monster, y'all"

close my eyes forever,lita ford and ozzy osbourne,1989," Baby I get so scared inside
And I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind
Or is it fantasy? Heaven is in the palm of my hand
And it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do
With a childhood tragedy? If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same? Sometimes, it's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me You're like a dagger
And stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me In your warm and darkened grave?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain the same?
Will you ever take me?
No, I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me? No, I'll never feel the same, oh
I know I've been so hard on you
I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?

this time i know it's for real
Walk a tightrope way up high
write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
you'd be amazed how much i love you so
when i get my hands on you, i won't let go
this time i know it's for real

if i wait too long for you, i might explode

I can still remember
They call me to tell me
You went away
It was such a cold day On a Sunday morning
It came without a warning
And all the pain I felt inside
I just can't forget you I'm feeling so alone
Though many times I've tried
I can't get you off my mind
I'm thinking of you
Wonder where you are tonight
I wish that I could hold you tight I'm thinking of you
Wish you could stay
But you're so far away, so far away And even though you're gone
I know you're happy where you are
I know someday will be together

the end of the innocence,don henley,1989," Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly But I know a place where we can go
That's still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie But I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence"

And dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside, I turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without It must have been love but it's over now

Guess what he told me
He said girl you better have fun
No matter what you do
But he's a fool 'Cause nothing compares

all i wanna do is make love to you,heart,1990," It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well
We made magic that night; oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to Oh, oooh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love Then it happened one day, we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me
Was the one little thing that you can All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too All I wanna do is make love to you

close to you,maxi priest,1990," She was A Jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' mi lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear Spinnin' mi 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true You make my dreams come true
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (Huh) And show you the way I feel (Huh-huh-huh)
She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds mi back or she too far
Windin' mi up just to let her down So emotional, gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked outside
With the full moon rising, I was scared I think I was possessed
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh) And show you the way I feel
I feel love
Every time your body's next to mine
Something deep inside of me Wants to love you endlessly
When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel She got an attitude, I can't explain
You never know if you're in frame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on the countdown till I get heard Her blood was hot, she burned so bright A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar
I just wanna be close to you I just wanna be close to you (Huh-huh-huh-huh)

White lightning, bound to drive you wild

Leads you on, then leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time? One day she'll treat you nice

Close my eyes and I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday but then it fades away Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain

Back before my heart was filled the pain
If only we could be in love that way again If whishes came true and all the dreams at night
Of love were real, Id be holding you
If whishes came true Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
We would be still be lovers, not apart
If whishes came true Now your√® gone and Im on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams I still feel your touch
Lying next to me feeling esctacy Take me back turn back the hands of time

Always special in your heart
We would still be lovers not apart

ice ice baby,vanilla ice,1990," Yo VIP, let's kick it Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0 With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
""Did you stop?"" No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby Take heed cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept We make it hype and you want to step
With this. Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say ""Damn!""
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby Yo man let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice ice baby too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold
Ice ice baby"

praying for time,george michael,1990," These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for
It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time"

Music hits me so hard
(That it) makes me say ""Oh, my Lord:
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet"".
It feels good when you know you're down,
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown.
And I'm known as such.
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch. I told you, homeboy:
Can't touch this.
Yeah, that's how we livin', and ya know:
Can't touch this.
Look in my eyes, man:
Can't touch this.
Yo! Let me bust the funky lyrics.
Can't touch this. Fresh new kicks and pants:
You got it like that, now you know you wanna dance.
So, move out of your seat
And get a fly girl, and catch this beat
While it's rollin'. Hold on:
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on
Like that. Like that:
Cold on a mission, so fall on back.
Let'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch. Yo! I told you:
Can't touch this.
Why you standing there, man?
Can't touch this.
Yo! Sound the bell: school's in, sucker.
Can't touch this. ""Give me a song or rhythm
Making no sweat"". That's what I'm giving'em
Now. They know
They talk about the Hammer when you're talking 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight.
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it's gonna take in the 90's to burn.
The chart's legit:
Either work hard or you might as well quit.
That's word, because, you know:
Can't touch this.
Can't touch this.
Break it down! Stop: Hammer time! Go with the flow. It is said.
If you can't groove to this, then you probably are dead.
So, wave your hands in the air,
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair.
This is it for a winner:
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner.
Now, move. Slide your rump.
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump:
Bump, bump, bump...
Yeah: can't touch this.
Look, man:
Can't touch this.
You'll probably get hyped, boy,
'Cause you know you can't.

Ring the bell: school's back in.
Break it down! Stop: Hammer time! Can't touch this.
Can't touch this.
Can't touch this.
Break it down! Stop: Hammer time! Every time you see me,
That Hammer's just so hype.
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mike.
Now, why would I ever
Stop doing this,
With others makin' records
That just don't hit?

From London to The Bay:
It's ""Hammer! Go, Hammer! MC Hammer! Yo, Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
""U can't touch this"". Can't touch this.

I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
and I even got my own dance
{Chorus:}
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Verse Two:
People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
that's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
but ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B,
all the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stoopid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
and now I'm gonna do my dance.
{Chorus}
Breakdown:
Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out
Verse Three:
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.
{Chorus}
Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Let's get stoopid!
{Chorus}
Oh, yeah, come on and break it down
Outro:
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
keep on doin' the Humpty Dance,
and to the ladies,
peace and humptiness forever"

what kind of man would i be,chicago,1990,
i remember you,skid row,1990," Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time, you were there for me Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you We spent the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said ""I love you babe,"" without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile, and die for your kiss Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all, we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true Oh my darling, I love you!
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day

Coming apart at the seams

Its the voice of hope, its the voice of peace, its the voice of every man.
From a distance we all have the love and no one is in need.
And there are no guns and no bombs and no disease, no hungry mouths to feed"

i dont wanna cry,mariah carey,1991," Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be Though I've give you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry, no, no, no All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make believing, on make believing
I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
Though I've given you my heart and soul oh baby
I must find a way of letting go

ive been thinking about you,londonbeat,1991," We've known each other
For a long long time
But I never really notcied
All the magic in your eyes
I've been around you
A thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more I must have been so blind
I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do
'Cause baby I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going through a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that
Finally opened my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time
I was oblivious so very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you
Sweet baby I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you (x2) Don't you know
That you're blowing my mind
What you do to me
I can't describe
Baby I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it

In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you

do anything,natural selection,1991," It's best this mess is part of the plan
The truth is moving under the ground You're sure the steering wheel
Is resting in your hands Tough to say You think success belongs to the bank
You take directions into the skin An ancient motor revving up
To keep it living on Strings tied to the hands
Hands upon a mouth Strings tied to the hands
Hands upon a mouth Strings tied to the hands
Hands upon a mouth Sneaky ways Sneaky ways The path is written before the act
A mode of growing seems like a choice It feels like progress
Is a product of a hidden game What obeys You measure hits by stuff in the house
It's more sincerely smiles on the face The instinct leads you if you do
Or if you don't want Tackle on a neck
Trapped within the ring Tackle on a neck
Trapped within the ring Tackle on a neck
Trapped within the rin Tough to say
What obeys Sneaky ways Sneaky ways"

It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much

And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try But that was just a dream
That was just a dream That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight

where does my heart beat now,celine dion,1991," So much to believe in
We were lost in time
Everything I needed
I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keepin
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go? Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go? Candle in the water
Drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger
Of the endless dream I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go? Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Where do all the lonely hearts go? Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
I've got someone to give my heart to
Feel it getting stronger and stronger
And stronger
And I feel inside
Hearts are made to last
Till the end of time"
summertime,dj jazzy jeff  the fresh prince,1991," Intro/Chorus: *sung* summer, summer, summertime
time to sit back and unwind Verse One: Fresh Prince Here it is the groove slightly transformed
just a bit of a break from the norm
just a little somethin' to break the monotony
of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
a little bit out of control it's cool to dance
but what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
give me a soft subtle mix
and if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
and think of the summers of the past
adjust the base and let the alpine blast
pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
and put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime Verse Two: Fresh Prince school is out and it's a sort of a buzz
but back then I didn't really know what it was
but now I see what have of this
the way that people respond to summer madness
the weather is hot and girls are dressing less
and checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
ridin around in your jeep or your benzos
or in your nissan stting on lorenzos
back in Philly we be ou in the park
a place called the plateau is where everybody go
guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
she turn around to see what you beeping at
it's like the summers a natural afrodesiac
and with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
to hit you and get you equipped for the summer time Verse Three: Fresh Prince it's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
hustle to the mall to get me a short set
yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
the temperature's about 88
hop in the water plug just for old times sake
break to ya crib change your clothes once more
cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise
about the days growing up and the first person you kissed
and as I think back makes me wonder how
the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
all the kids playing out front
little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch
while the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
then six o'clock rolls around
you just finished wiping your car down
it's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
it looks like a car show
everybody come lookin real fine
fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
every moment frontin and maxin
chillin in the car they spent all day waxin
leanin to the side but you can't speed through
two miles an hour so everybody sees you
there's an air of love and of happiness
and this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness"

Love may still exist in another place
Running undercover of a helicopter blade
The flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, some day
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you baby, oh baby Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home

Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle, no expression on my face Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue

Thought to myself then started to shrug
Got to the door. Ding Dong. Who is it?
My girl's best friend had payed me a visit.
Sly as can be, tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful. I really didn't have the gall.
I tried to chill. She made the move.
Now I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve.
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girl didn't trust me. No!

Ruin your life, sleep with your wife
Watch your behind
There was a friend of mine named Jay
Would come over late at night and say hey
I watched the fight. I thought is was alright.
'Cause me and Jay were really really tight
So damned close we had the same blood type.
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
So I let Jay move into the crib and chill
He had his own room and helped pay the bills
The time had come (for the baby down to the scene)

And he's not even hungry, he wants to be treat
To the bedroom he said his head hurts

Mysterious calls and the phone goes click
You say to yourself ""I'm gonna hit him with a brick""
Ain't no way he could be cheatin' on me

toms diner,dna featuring suzanne vega,1991," I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in It is always
Nice to see you
Says the man
Behind the counter To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos I'm pretending
Not to see them
Instead
I pour the milk I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor
Who had died
While he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking For the funnies
When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so I raise my head
There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside Does she see me?
No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection
And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt
And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Has gotten wet
Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening
To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice..."

around the way girl,ll cool j,1991," (You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
(On your loving) I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings
At least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion
Using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl (You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving) Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in them
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap but petty
You're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
(Oooh you love me)
Come around my way I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around the way girl (You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving) Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here
You say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your home girls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for whining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee I love youYou're from around the way I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him
(You got me shook)
I need an around the way girl
An around the way girl
Fine as can be
(Oooh you love me)
She oh yea
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
The only one for me

I'll be there In those times when you feel all alone
Forced to find your way through worlds unknown
Look ahead and don't be scared

I'll be there when the nights falls and troubles rise
I'll be there when you need me

No more smiles
Goodbye letters on the ground
When no one will spare their ears

All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside, so afraid that I've lost my faith Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Please, show me the way And as I slowly drift to sleep, for a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace in a world so filled with hatred
Then I wake up each morning and turn on the news to find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign, so afraid I just won't know Show me the way, show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away
And show me the way And if I see your light, should I believe
Tell me how will I know Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away Show me the way, show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday
And please show me the way Every night I say a prayer in the hopes that there's a heaven..."

I don't wanna be here alone Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now

To let you go

You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me

To heal when you're hurting so much

on a foreign shore
to find his country didn't want him back
their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
our lawyers took his wife and kids no regrets
In a time I don't remember
in a war he can't forget

My best friend died a lonely man
in some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
and they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down n cry
as the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
like a lost soul out of place
and the Mirror mirror on the wall sees my smile it fades again
and give me something to believe in (I give me something to believe in)
if there's lord above and give me something to believe in (I give me something to believe in)
Oh, lord arise
Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now things I didn't know then Road you gotta take me home
Solo
I drive by the homeless
sleepin' on a cold dark street
like bodies in an old bone grave
underneath the broken old neon sign
used to read ""Jesus saves""
A mile away live the rich folk
and I see how they're livin' it up
but while the poor they eat from hand to mouth
the rich are drinkin' from a golden cup and it just makes me wonder
why so many lose and so few win... Ha!
Give me something to believe in
give me something to believe in
If there's a lord above
give me something to believe in
oh lord arise
give me something to believe in
you take the high road
give me something to believe in
and I'll take the low road
give me something to believe in

and give me something to believe in
and I'll take the low road

things I didn't know then... yeah.

silent lucidity,"queensr""yche",1991," Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun? There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension I... will be watching over you
I... am gonna help you see it through
I... will protect you in the night
I... am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity I can't do this
Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Help me If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once, you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...
I... will be watching over you
I... am gonna help to see it through
I... will protect you in the night
I... am smiling next to you..."

Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, oh no, just because I like to see you, but then again

Keep them so cool and so contained

Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream

Love can be so misleading
I'd cross the earth both land and sea
When I feel that moment badgering me
Could be it's just illusion
But in feeling something good indeed
Is this where loving starts to mirror my dreams
Cos you give me a good vibe don't you know baby
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby

And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays You're so fine

Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the dealings
Turn around
Am I looking at salvation
Make me realize all that I am

all this time,sting,1991," I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly
To the sea Two priests came round our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach
Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black
Like a murder of crows And all this time, the river flowed
Endlessly
to the sea
If I had my way, I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea Blessed are the poor
for they shall inherit the earth
(One is) Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of a needle
And as these words were spoken i swear i hear
The old man laughing,
'what good is a used up world, and how could it be
Worth having' And all this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
And all this time the river flowed
Father, if jesus exists,
Then how come he never lived here?
Yeah, yeah Teachers told us
The romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple on the edge of the
Empire garrison town,
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods
But the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled
'Til all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found And all this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a northern sun
If i had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations
But they only get better
One by one
One by one, by one
One by one I looked out across

Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Saw two priests on the ferry

I'm not the same as all the rest I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me
I've been a player in the crowd scene A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations, and years above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride
I can't wear this uniform without some compromises Because you'll find out that we come In different shapes and sizes

You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary) It's OPP, time other people's what you get it

miles away,winger,1991," So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for
Some times, just for a moment
I reach out hope you're still there Miles away
No you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...
It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most You were miles away
When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone.
With only you promises...
Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you just memories No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me
Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away
No you're never turnin' back I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, whoa-oh
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were mi-les a-way..."
do you want me,saltnpepa,1991," You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby Do you really want me, baby? Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up Do you really want me, baby? Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like Who me? A tease? Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song Do you really want me, baby? Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like"

I don't have no time for you to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just wait We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind? Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye? When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go

You just don't realize
You've never been there before

Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I Will you love me again like you loved me before?

You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not about to go out on cheat you (Maybe I'll forgive you)

baby got back,sir mixalot,1992," Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends.
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because,
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (yeah) Fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (shake it) shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt

I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song

'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (Yeah) Ladies (Yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (Yeah)

Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

i love your smile,shanice,1992," Sittin' in my class, just driftin' away
Starin' into the windows of the world, yeah
I can't hear the teacher, his books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play 'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile The clock at work says, ""Three""
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway 'Cause I love your smile
Hey said, ""I love your smile"" Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know, I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give

Shanice is the one
For you to be with

black or white,michael jackson,1992," I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none And I told about equality
An it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations Causing grief in human relations It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white"
achy breaky heart,billy ray cyrus,1992," You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone. You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Oooh You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
Or you can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff who's fist can tell my lips
He never really liked me anyway Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Oooh But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

november rain,guns n roses,1992,
life is a highway,tom cochrane,1992," Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way I want to drive it all night long Through all these cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once but now
We look it in the eye
There ain't no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

I just can't describe it, oh no no

Right in front of my face My feelings can't describe it
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

this used to be my playground,madonna,1992," Chorus (first time without background vocals): This used to be my playground [used to be]
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say Don't look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why
Because life is short
And before you know
You're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask (Long and movie versions only:) (chorus)
Live and learn
Well the years they flew
And we never knew
We were foolish then
We would never tire
And that little fire
Is still alive in me
It will never go away
Can't say goodbye to yesterday [can't say goodbye] (chorus) No regrets
But I wish that you
Were here with me
Well then there's hope yet
I can see your face
In our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday [the dream]
Those are words I'll never say [I'll never say] This used to be my playground [used to be]
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy (Short and movie versions only:) This used to be our playground [used to be]
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me (Movie version only:) This used to be our playground [used to be]
This used to be our great escape
This used to be the place we ran to
This used to be our secret hiding place This used to be our playground [used to be]

sometimes love just aint enough,patty smyth,1992," Now I don't wanna lose you
But I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side And I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you
But I don't wanna be the one to cry And that don't really matter to anyone, anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough Now I could never change you
And I don't wanna blame you
Baby you don't have to take the fault Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed?
There beside you, where I used to lay
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby sometimes love, it just ain't enough"

Dying to understand

Cherish you right
Don't you know
You were my life Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone Do you even realize
The sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try
To deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind No I just can't get you out of my mind
I never can say goodbye
'Cause every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know

To what we had
The good times that made us laugh
Outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesteday I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain

bohemian rhapsody,queen,1992," Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come
Easy go
Little high
Little low Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me Mama
Just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama
Life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters Too late
My time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all (Ooh, ooh) I see a little silhouetto of a man

For me
For me So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby

tennessee,arrested development,1992," Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messing up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home) Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan
(repeat) Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyesburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home) Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan Eshe? She went down to Holly Springs.
Rasha Don and Baba? They went down to Peachtree.
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes.
A game of horseshoes! Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
My brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And you was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty...
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for
Are the answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee Take me to another place (Home)
Take me to another land (Home)
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan Oh won't you let me
Won't you help me
Won't you help me understand you plan?
Take me home
Take me home
Home
Take me to another place
Take me home
Oh you know I need to go home, yeah Headliner? I won the game of horseshoes.
Now you owe me a watermelon.
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks,
do like they do below the border.
Hmm? Speech's hair?
No it look like the roots of the tree my ancestors were hung from.
But that's okay, get it, 'cuz he's down to earth.

So very young and so afraid No proper shoes upon my feet

Still I had to keep on going Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night

when a man loves a woman,michael bolton,1992," When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
And turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
And trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it ought to be
When a man loves a woman I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
And baby baby please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels 'Cause baby, baby
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman

people everyday,arrested development,1992," See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see? Outta nowhere comes a woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it Well I stay calm and pray the niggaz leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me I am everyday people, yeah
See I am everyday people, yeah I told the niggaz please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't
But I had to take the brother out for being rude And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African You see

peace of mind was hard to find
and I needed a place where I could hide
somewhere I could call mine I didn't think much about it
til it started happening all the time
soon I was living with the fear everyday
of what might happen that night I couldn't stand to hear the
crying of my mother
and I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again they say that time is a healer
and now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say He sat me down to talk to me
he looked me straight in the eyes He said: You're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
and you're no son, no son of mine oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
and as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it You're no son, you're no son of mine
but where should I go,
and what should I do
you're no son, you're no son of mine
but I came here for help, oh I came here for you Well the years they passed so slowly
I thought about him everyday
what would I do, if we passed on the street
would I keep running away in and out of hiding places
soon I'd have to face the facts
we'd have to sit down and talk it over
and that would mean going back they say that time is a healer
and now my wounds are not the same
I rang that bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say He sat me down to talk to me

Tell me you will be there
Help me please - darlin' rescue me Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see - darlin' rescue me I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standin' in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today
Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you - how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?"
friday im in love,the cure,1992," I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love
Saturday wait
Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate

Thursday never looking back

Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Oh, Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love
Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate
Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throw out your frown
And just smile at the sound
And as sleek as a sheikh
Spinning round round round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you in, in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start

everything about you,ugly kid joe,1992," I hate the rain and sunny weather
And I hate beach and mountains too
(And) I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the countryside too! And I, hate everything about you!
...Everything about you! And I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too
And I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no
'Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too And I get sick when I'm around, I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you!
Everything about you, everything about you, everything about you! Some say I've got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again 'cause I ain't wearing no frown! Well, I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch, 'cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad
Well that's too bad
'Cause I'm havin'
A ball hatin'
Every little thing about you! ha-ha!
Everything about you, everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about...

missing you now,michael bolton,1992," I talk to you but it's not the same
As touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name
I wanna run to you We'll be together
It won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever
And its hard to be strong
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
And its drivin' me crazy, how I'm needin' you baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you To show you how I'm missing you now
Wishin' you were here by my side
Is all that I can do
My arms around my pillow at night They should be holdin' you
Thought I was stronger
How could I know, how could I know
I can't take this much longer It's so hard on my soul
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now And its drivin' me crazy, I gotta be with you baby
I'm missing you now
Don't know what I'm gonna do
The way I'm missing you now Baby I just can't wait, till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then, will I be satisfied
I'm missing you now I know, we'll be together

back to the hotel,n2deep,1992," V-Town, brother, check it out, I'm 'bout to throw down
Dick in hand, the shit that had you toked down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boyz don't play, fool
Yorker sidin', you know how the songs goes
In the back, sippin' purple chongos
Don't look for trouble, but it always seems to find us
Forty-grippin', panties, sippin', and these finks are right behind us
Quick left, one blow, K.O.
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh, what the hell, I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Hen, for me to get bent on
Hit the country club to pick up ML
Eighty West, back to the hotel At the Telly, Bones is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The Latina on the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me, babydoll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night, so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, brothers strikin' through to be seen
A Lexus 400 to the triple gold Z's
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin kinda funky
A sick honkey, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin' in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the Telly, I gotta get some ""nuca"" Aw naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her, so I called TL
Smooth me up, Sally wanted new dick
And Monty licked, so try an' make it real quick Aw yeah, I jumped in the F-train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store, man
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjacks
We got the goods, now we're headed for the hoe down
There goes the Telly, so fella, won't you slow down?
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case we gotta bust a quick one
Locked and loaded, let's go look for, like, one-eighteen
But lay low cause I really don't wanna be seen
""Is this the room?""
Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the light, man, I just might, man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some L
So I can cut turf and hit another hotel"

As you can feel and will see Oh tell me why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds are here when you're with me
Express the way that you feel
And you say... In a passionate set we're moving close
Every bit of love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide Chorus (repeats twice) Mike's monolauge:
The music is low
The lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows
With every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust and a lot love
Sweet caresses and yes' to me as you rub
And clench my back
Ecstacy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck
And stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight
I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty Chorus (repeats a lot and fades out)"

what about your friends,tlc,1992," What about your friends?
What about?
What about your friends?
What about, what about? Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say I supply creativity
To what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own? I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there with you through the thick and thin What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you
Yo, this is me, well is it me or can it be I'm a little too friendly So to speak hypothetically say I supply creativity
To what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around

What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you
People say I act a little funny, I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me, yeah, yeah
Even though I might seem easy, it don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?

thats what love is for,amy grant,1992," Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for Sometimes I see you and you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away by emotions
I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire and holding on we find That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for Believing in the one thing
That has gotten us this far That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it Round off the edges
Talk us down from the ledges
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for That's what love is for
That's what love is for
That's what love is for Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for That's what love is for
That's what love is for
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Try to sense through it"

just take my heart,mr big,1992," It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
I can't imagine living my life after you're gone.
'Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you
But you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself
I know there's no turning back
Face to face it's been endless conversation
But when the love is gone
You're left with nothing but talk I'd give my everything
If only I could turn you around
But if this is goodbye Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you
But you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go Just take my heart! Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you
But you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart, baby just take my heart when you go
Take my heart.
Just take my heart."
i will remember you,amy grant,1992," I will be walking one day
Down a street far away
And see a face in the crowd and smile
Knowing how you made me laugh
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past
I will remember you. Look into my eyes while you're near
Tell me what's happening here
See that I don't want to say good-bye
Our love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember you. Later on
When this fire is an ember
Later on
When the nights not so tender
Given time
Though it's hard to remember darlin'
I will be holding
I'll still be holding to you
I will remember you. So many years come and gone
And yet the memory is strong
One word we never could learn
Good-bye
True love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember you
So please remember
