He was walking along the road
And I asked him, Tell where are you going?
This he told me Said, I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm,
Gonna join in a rock and roll band.
Got to get back to the land and set my soul free. [Chorus]
We are stardust, we are golden,
We are billion year old carbon,
And we got to get ourselves back to the garden. Well, then can I walk beside you?
I have come to lose the smog,
And I feel like I'm a cog in something turning.
And maybe it's the time of year,
Yes and maybe it's the time of man.
And I don't know who I am,
But life is for learning. [Chorus: x2] By the time we got to Woodstock,
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song and a celebration.
And I dreamed I saw the bomber death planes
Riding shotgun in the sky,
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation. We are stardust, we are golden,
We caught in the devil's bargain,
And we got to get ourselves back to the garden."

the night they drove old dixie down,joan baez,1971," Virgil Caine is my name and I drove on the Danville train
Till Stonemans Cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond that fell
It was a time I remember, oh, so well The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went, ""Na, na, na"" Back with my wife in Tennessee and one day she said to me
""Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee""
Now I don't mind, I'm chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
Follow the bouncing arm The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went, ""Na, na, na"" Like my father before me, I'm a working man
And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
But he was just 18, proud and brave
But a yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went, ""Na, na, na"""

thats the way ive always heard it should be,carly simon,1971," My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark.
The living room is still;
I walk by, no remark.
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines.
I hear her call sweet dreams,
But I forgot how to dream. But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own, you and me -
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be:
You want to marry me, we'll marry. My friends from college they're all married now;
They have their houses and their lawns.
They have their silent noons,
Tearful nights, angry dawns.
Their children hate them for the things they're not;
They hate themselves for what they are-
And yet they drink, they laugh,
Close the wound, hide the scar. But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own, you and me -
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be:
You want to marry me, we'll marry. You say we can keep our love alive
Babe - all I know is what I see -
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris.
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds,
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf -
I'll never learn to be just me first
By myself. Well O.K., it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own, you and me -
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be,
You want to marry me, we'll marry,
We'll marry."

But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas

screaming out the words I dread

I'd hide it to myself
and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it
when you walked into the room
I think I love you
(I think I love you) I think I love you
so what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for I think I love you
isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
that I never felt this way... I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about

so what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for I think I love you
isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I never felt this way Believe me
you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy

Were the gifts you gave

Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there, at my command
My love And the first time, ever I lay with you

Would fill the earth

alone again naturally,gilbert osullivan,1972," In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to
Make it clear to whoever
Wants to know what it's like When you're shattered Left standing in the lurch at a church
Were people saying, My God, that's tough
She stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally To think that only yesterday I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces Leaving me to doubt
Talk about, God in His mercy Oh, if he really does exist
Why did he desert me
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally It seems to me that
There are more hearts broken in the world
That can't be mended Left unattended
What do we do
What do we do
Alone again, naturally Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"
american pie,don mclean,1972," A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"" Did you write the book of love, and do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll, can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"" Now for ten years we've been on our own, and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen in a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Helter skelter in a summer swelter, the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass, the players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Oh, and there we were all in one place, a generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'
bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
I met a girl who sang the blues, and I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' This'll be the day that I die"""

He came on a summers day - bearing gifts - from far away
But he made it clear he couldnt stay The harbor was his home
Brandy, you're a fine girl
(you're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
Brandy used to watch his eyes
As he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a slient town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say..."

long cool woman in a black dress,the hollies,1972," Miscellaneous
Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men Whisky bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man When I heard this woman singing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5-9 beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess 'Cos that long cool woman had it all
...
I saw her heading to the table
Well a tall walking big black cat When Charlie said I hope that you're able boy
Well I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Well then suddenly we heard a siren
And everybody started to run Jumping out of doors and tables
Well I heard somebody shooting a gun
Well the DA was pumping my left hand
And she was holding my right
Well I told her don't get scared 'Cos you're gonna be spared
Well I'm gonna be forgiven
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5-9 beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess

a horse with no name,america,1972," On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed Made me sad to think it was dead
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La, la
After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground But the humans will give no love
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

city of new orleans,arlo guthrie,1972," The City of New Orleans
by Steve Goodman Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles. CHORUS:
Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done. Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel. CHORUS Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues. Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done. ©1970, 1971 EMI U Catalogue, Inc and Turnpike Tom Music (ASCAP)"
garden party,ricky nelson,1972," Nelson I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, I didn't look the same. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. People came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her Walrus, there was magic in the air
And over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. Lott-in-dah-dah-dah, lot-in-dah-dah-dah. Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said hello to Mary Lou, she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah) lot-in-dah-dah-dah. Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah) lot-in-dah-dah-dah. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself."

Is because she picked up a man of mine Chumpin' slick was my ruin

Was making it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh yeah
Just making it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, uh-huh, um-hum I took this man's love and put it a shelf
And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself When you needed love I was out having fun
But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, uh-huh
Yeah, that's what I did, I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, oh yeah The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street
So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough
I mean, she really cleans up"

taxi,harry chapin,1972," It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light ""Oh where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain""
She just looked out the window
She said, ""Sixteen Parkside Lane"" Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles and the too little smiles
I still remember you."" It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far You see she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky Oh, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind. Oh, I've got something inside me
But it's not what my life's about,
Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
Cause she's dying, aren't we all There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars for a two fifty fare
She said, ""Harry, keep the change."" Well another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt And she walked away in silence
It's strange how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago You see she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off for the sky And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips and getting stoned I go flying so high, when I'm stoned"
i saw the light,todd rundgren,1972," It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes, in your eyes Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
Till that little bell began to ring
In my head, in my head But I tried to run
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said 'Cause my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
Till I saw the light
In your eyes, in your eyes But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes

They make the children really ring

Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

doctor my eyes,jackson browne,1972," Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can? Doctor, my eyes, tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long 'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems Doctor, my eyes, tell me what you see
I hear their cries, just say if it's too late for me Doctor, my eyes, cannot see the sky
Is this the price for having learned how not to cry"
id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony,the new seekers,1972," I'd like to build a world a home

And snow white turtle doves I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace throughout the land That's the song I hear
Let the world sing today
A song of peace that echoes on
And never goes away I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony

vincent,don mclean,1972," Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land Now I understand what you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow Now I think I know what you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"

youre so vain,carly simon,1973," Son of a gun
You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte

You probably think this song is about you You're so vain (you're so vain)
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you don't you? You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee and
You're so vain You probably think this song is about you

And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun

And when you're not you're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend wife of a close friend and

Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night

Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning

Leave me as you found me, empty like before (Hey!)
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning

Then just walk away

We don't have tomorrow,

Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was ameetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky She's forty one and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?

wildflower,skylark,1973," She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence in her ears Let her cry, for she's a lady (She's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child (Child)
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild And if by chance I should hold her (If by chance that I should hold her)
Let me hold her for a time (Let me hold her for a time)
But if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden to be mine (I would pick her from the garden to be mine) Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Be careful how you touch her, for she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always payin' for a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear, and so she goes Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild Let her cry, for she's a lady (She's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
She's a flower growing wild

rocky mountain high,john denver,1973," He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him
You might say he was born again You might say he found a key to ev'ry door.
When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken, and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast, and it don't last for long But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight
Is softer than a lullaby
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky mountain high (Colorado) He climbed cathedral mountains
He saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once
And he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude
The forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside
Himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply Rocky mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky mountain high (Colorado) Now his life is full of wonder
But his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing, he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
He knows he'd be a poorer man
If he never saw an eagle fly Rocky mountain high
Colorado rocky mountain high I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire
And everybody's high

The sun is gonna shine above And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind, better take him home
Yeah, and don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky

Right in the gym or hype in them, alright then
All day I drink and smoke
Shell toe with ankles in ya both

yesterday once more,the carpenters,1973," When I was young
I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile. Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well. Every Sha-la-la-la
Every Wo-o-wo-o
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine. When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more. Lookin' back on how it was
In years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed. It was songs of love that
I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away. Every Sha-la-la-la
Every Wo-o-wo-o
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine. All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry.
Just like before
It's yesterday once more."
boogie woogie bugle boy,bette midler,1973," He was a famous trumpet man out Chicago way

And he was gone with the draft, he's in the army now a blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he could not jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted the band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot, he blows it eight to the bar
In boogie rhythm, he can't blow a note unless a bass
And guitar is playin' with him and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
He was some boogie woogie bugle boy of company B When he played his boogie woogie bugle, he was busy as a busy bee
And when he played he made the company jump eight to the bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
Andata toodliata-toodliata toot toot, he blows it eight to the bar
He can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't with him
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
'Cause they know how it goes when someone gives him a beat

If you won't then there's no point for me to even begin to tell you
Somethings are better left unsaid Despite the desperation in my head
Somethings are better left alone
But i'm left with no words
And all i want to do is shout out loud
All the sticks and stones that you've been throwing at me
How they're killing me, oh why
Every night i try to sleep Toss and turn in my bed Thoughts ring out in my head
And i got to get away from here
From the voice that i find ways to poison my mind
For i never thought that i would be
The one breaking my track, the one pulling me back
Don't killing me
Don't killing me
I said what you want to Now i've done what i've done
'cause though i've tried to be real
But that's just left me undone
All this pain that i feel will leave a stain on my skin
And the marks that they leave expose the shadows within
I'll show you
I wish that things were better left unsaid I wish that there was peace inside my head
I guess that we are better left alone
'cause if i find the right words i know i'll have to shout them out
All the sticks and stones that you've been throwing at me
How they're killing me, oh why
Every night i try to sleep
Toss and turn in my bed

Misty watercolor memories

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we? Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"

You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die

you make me feel brand new,the stylistics,1974," My love
I'll never find the words my love
To tell you how I feel my love

dark lady,cher,1974," The fortune queen of New Orleans
brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the back seat were scratches
From the marks of men her fortune she had won
Couldn't see through the tinted glass
She said, ""Home James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room
She took my money, she said, ""I'll be with you soon"" CHORUS:
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music
Till her brew was done
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words
That were so strange to me
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red but the card
Still stayed black
She said the man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face So I ran home and crawled in my bed
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume
And how I smelled it once in my own room
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore"

And they talk about it still When a man named al capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
Against the forces of the law I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night chicago died
Brother, what a night it really was
Brother, what a fight it really was
Glory be
I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night chicago died
Brother, what a night the people saw
Brother, what a fight the people saw
Yes, indeed
And the sound of the battle rang Through the streets of the old east side
'til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died
There was shouting in the street And the sound of running feet
And i asked someone who said
'bout a hundred cops are dead
I heard my momma cry I heard her pray the night chicago died Brother, what a night it really was
Brother, what a fight it really was
Glory be I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night chicago died
Brother, what a night the people saw
Brother, what a fight the people saw Yes, indeed
Then there was no sound at all
But the clock up on the wall
Then the door burst open wide
And my daddy stepped inside
And he kissed my momma's face
Then brushed her tears away
The night chicago died
(nanananananananananana)
The night chicago died
Brother, what a night the people saw
Brother, what a fight the people saw
yes, indeed
The night chicago died

I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues So goodbye yellow brick road

Hunting the horny back toad

Beyond the yellow brick road What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground So goodbye yellow brick road

Old pick-up trucks,
Slow movin trains, and rain. I love little country streams,
Sleep without dreams,
Sunday school in May, and hay. And I love you too. I love leaves in the wind,
Pictures of my friends,
Birds of the world, and squirrels. I love coffee in a cup,
Little fuzzy pups,
Bourbon in a glass, and grass. And I love you too. I love honest open smiles,
Kisses from a child,
Tomatoes on a vine, and onions. I love winners when they cry,
Losers when they try,
Music when it's good, and life. And I love you too."

at seventeen,janis ian,1975," I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
and murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
Indebentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen To those of us who know the pain
of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
and murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen"

lucy in the sky with diamonds,elton john,1975," Picture yourself in a boat on a river

Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaaah Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh my Mandy Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh my Mandy I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing The tears are in my mind
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy
Yesterday's a dream I face the morning
Crying on a breeze The pain is calling, oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without taking But I sent you away, oh Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy

Have you never let someone else be strong? Running around as you do with your head up in the clouds

Never had time to lay back, kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you

And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you dad
You know I'm gonna be like you"" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's ok""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah

See you later, can I have them please?"" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

You see my new job's a hassle and kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you"" And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me

Maybe you can see all the things you've been to me
But my simple fate is at the gate, and, girl, you've got the key [Chorus] It seems like yesterday you and I first loved this way
But now, I know how love can grow with each and every day
As we lay at midnight's hour and feel love's hidden power
So strong and bold as life unfolds its mystery to me [Chorus] You and me for eternity, in love, we'll always be
Young and free and that should be the way it's gotta be [Chorus]"

And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am just missing you again Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee But I guess I'd better get myself together
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said ""I'm sorry"" by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind
Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again"

Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me Baby, you're no good I'm gonna say it again
Baby, you're no good I'm telling you now, baby

someone saved my life tonight,elton john,1975," When I think of those east end lights
Muggy nights the curtains drawn
In the little room downstairs
Prima donna Lord you really should have been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there rolling 'round the basement floor
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...) And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear (sugar bear...) You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound hypnotized sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...) Never realized the passing hours of evening showers
Slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn outplayed by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time
Thank God my music is still alive
(aah-aah-aah-aah-aah...) And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
(sugar bear sugar bear...)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound hypnotized sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
Coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone
And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
(sugar bear sugar bear)
(sugar bear...)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound
Hypnotized
Sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye

Ray Stevens
(Erroll Garner/Johnny Burke) Covered many times, this song has had at least
four top 40 appearances, with one of the best-known
by Johnny Mathis in 1959. Ray's ""country-fied"" version
peaked at #14 in 1975, and gave him his second Grammy. Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
Ah, I'm walkin' on a cloud
I can't understand, Lord
I'm misty holdin' your hand Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your ""hello""
That music I hear, Lord
I'm misty the moment you're near You can say that you're leadin' me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm followin' you Ooh, on my own
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now
Never knowin' my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, Lord
I'm misty, and too much in love You can say that you're leadin' me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm followin' you Ooh, on my own
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now
Never knowin' my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, Lord

only yesterday,the carpenters,1975," After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was goin' through
And waitin' was all my heart could do Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of mornin' light
Filling the world surroundin' me When I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song, singin' forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow maybe even brighter than today Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see
When I hold you Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song, singin' forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow maybe even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday (Only yesterday) {Only yesterday}
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me"

Skyrockets in flight!

times of your life,paul anka,1976," Good morning, yesterday
You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember, do you remember The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember, do you remember
The times of your life (do you remember) Reach back for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
The mem'ries are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow Here comes the setting sun (comes the setting sun)
The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember, will you remember
The times of your life Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember, will you remember
The times of your life
Of your life
Of your life Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life
Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life"

Let me see the lines on your hand

Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd came there for She's just a devil woman

We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of weeping disappear every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try... ooh... ooh...

Of getting it on

That you make new plans

You're paying everyones bills
And they tell you that
You're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is that who you really are Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can
Remember the time
When I sang my songs for free Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then
My heart keeps going home Talking on the telephone
Setting up another day
Of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Staying in touch with the street When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
Cause in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is this what its all about Country boy

evergreen love theme from a star is born,barbra streisand,1977," Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen"

To believe everything you say is true
Well that just goes to show
That you really don't know
While you're out painting the town
Do you think I'm home just sitting around
Waiting on you
Now who's really the fool When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out till I got to know her
So I drived away as she got over
And I became just like her So don't be surprised to find that
The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of loving me
Why do you keep holding on
When love was already gone
The time you said you wasn't feeling well
Did you think I couldn't tell
You've been with someone else
You were only kidding yourself When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out till I got to know her
So I drived away as she got over
And I became just like her so don't be surprised to find
The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning

hotel california,eagles,1977," On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say... Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget So I called up the Captain,
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine""
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say... Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device""
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax, "" said the night man,
""We are programmed to receive.
You can check-out any time you like,
But you can never leave! """

Across from the depot
On a barstool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her, her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said, ""I'm no quitter""
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
Now his big hands were calloused,
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin'
His big heart was breakin'
And he turned to the woman and said
""You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and crops in the field
I've had some bad times,
Lived through some sad times
But this time the hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
And from the lights of the barroom
To the rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all
Now she was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
'Cause I couldn't hold her
The words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time
""You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and crops in the field
And I've had some bad times,
I lived through some sad times
But this time the hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

the things we do for love,10cc,1977," Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love. Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love. Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up. Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall. Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go

You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up. Ooh you made me love you

If the real thing don't do the trick You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick

Dive down deep to save my head You, I think you got the blues too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools
If the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Oooo, Barra-Barracuda"

youre my world,helen reddy,1977," You're my world, you're every breath I take,
You're my world, you're every move I make,
Other eyes see the stars up in the skies,
but for me they shine within your eyes.
As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine,
I feel a power so divine You're my world you are my night and day
You're my world you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world for me. With your hand resting in mine,
I feel a power so divine You're my world you are my night and day,
You're my world you're every prayer I pray

End of my world for me."

carry on wayward son,kansas,1977," Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more Ah Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming,
I can hear them say Carry on my wayward son,
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man,
Well, it surely means that I don't know On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune,
But I hear the voices say Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more no! Carry on,
You will always remember
Carry on,
Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry,
Don't you cry no more, No more!"

weekend in new england,barry manilow,1977," Last night I waved goodbye now it seems years
I'm back in the city where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you bringing us near
And tell me when will our eyes meet when can I touch you...
When will this strong yearning end...
And when will I hold you again?
Time in New England took me away to long rocky beaches you by the bay
We started a story whose end must now wait And tell me when will our eyes meet... when can I touch you...
When will this strong yearning end...
And when will I hold you again?
I feel the change comin' I feel the wind blow I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow...
With you I could bring out all the love that I have
With you there's a heaven
So earth ain't so bad...
And tell me when will our eyes meet... when can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end...
And when will I hold you... again... again?"

January through December ... we had such a perfect year,
Then the flames became a dying ember ...
All at once you weren't here. Now my broken heart ... cries for you each night,
And it's almost like a song ... but it's much too sad to write. (SOLO) Now my broken heart ... cries for you each night,
And it's almost like a song ... but it's much to sad to write ...
Much too sad to write."

Like this! Schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this! Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle""
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Just gimme a kiss
Like this!"
year of the cat,al stewart,1977," On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came In the year of the cat She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, ""I feel my life
Just like a river running through"" The year of the cat Why she looks at you so coolly?
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside The year of the cat Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So you have to stay on But the drumbeat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay In the year of the cat
Year of the cat"

Never again to be all alone 'Cause you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song 'Cause you, you light up my life

I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say,
""Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"" You've been strung up for her too long,
You know - girls will come and go -
They're just like streetcars...

Sometimes I feel so
Abandoned... Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Oh everybody waits so long
Oh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come on! Come on! I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
I've been stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
People ask me, ""What's the matter with you boy?"" Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

baker street,gerry rafferty,1978," Winding your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well, another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now
Another year and then you'd be happy Just one more year and then you'd be happy But you're crying, you're crying now Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands
And then he'll settle down
In some quiet little town
And forget about everything But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
And when you wake up, it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
And you're going, you're going home"

two out of three aint bad,meat loaf,1978," Maybe we can talk all night,

I told you everything I possibly can,
there's nothin' left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night,
but that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside,
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out,
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long,
I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears
And all I can do, is keep on tellin' you
I want you (I want you),
I need you (I need you)

To give you somethin', somethin' that I just haven't got (woh-oh)

And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooh-ooh I know
Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Ahh, she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away
And she kept on tellin' me,
She kept on tellin' me,
She kept on tellin' me

sometimes when we touch,dan hill,1978," You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter Still trapped within my youth
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you And I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides"

That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, beardsly prints

an everlasting love,andy gibb,1978," I've been here all your life watchin' your crying game

And an everlasting love will never die Take me out of the cold, give me what I've hungered for
If it's the pleasure of takin' my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try Ah, we got an everlasting love

goodbye girl,david gates,1978," All your life you've waited
For love to come and stay
And now that I have found you
You must not slip away I know it's hard believing
The words you've heard before
But darlin', you must trust them
Just once more 'Cause, baby, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean
We'll never be together again
If you wake up and I'm not there I won't be long away
'Cause the things you do my goodbye girl
Will bring me back to you
I know you've been taken
Afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me
Instead of givin' in
But I can wait forever
For helpin' you to see
That I was meant for you
And you for me
So remember, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean
We'll never be together again
Though we may be so far apart
You still will have my heart
So forget your past my goodbye girl

still the same,bob seger  the silver bullet band,1978," You always won every time you placed a bet
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Every time they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk You always said the cards would never do you wrong
The trick, you said, was never play the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by
You're still the same
You still aim high There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say 'Cause you're still the same
You're still the same
Moving game to game
Some things never change
You're still the same"

When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes They say I won't last too long on Broadway

We'll search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, ohh Lord, I'll try
To carry on I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had We'll live happily forever
So the story goes
But somehow we missed out
On the pot of gold
But we'll try
Best that we can
To carry on A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said
They said come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
They climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies
Singing come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me

you needed me,anne murray,1978," I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind
I sold my soul You bought it back for me
And held me up
And gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me You gave me strength To stand alone again
To face the world Out on my own again
You put me high Upon a pedestal
So high that I could Almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you
And you were there
And I'll never leave
Why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I've finally found
Someone who really cares
You held my hand
When it was cold
When I was lost
You took me home
You gave me hope
When I was at the end
And turned my lies
Back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could
Almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?
How to tell you girl...
I wanna build my world around you...
Tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand I'm talking about a lifetime plan...
That's the way it began we were hand in hand
Glenn Miller's band was better than before We yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tune
(Night and Day) Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home I promised you'd never be alone...
Hurry don't be late
I can hardly wait I said to myself when we're old We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
Friday night it was late I was walking you home we got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right? Now as the years roll on...

count on me,jefferson starship,1978," Precious love, I'll give it to you

running on empty,jackson browne,1978," Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-on-one
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on Running on-running on empty
Running on-running blind
Running on-running into the sun But I'm running behind
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on
Running on-running on empty
Running on-running blind Running on-running into the sun
But I'm running behind
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too
Running on-running on empty Running on-running blind
Running on-running into the sun
But I'm running behind

You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find

dont look back,boston,1978," 8Don't look back, a new day is breakin
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin, today is the day I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around I finally see the dawn arrivin
I see beyond the road I'm drivin It's a bright horizon and I'm awaken
I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin, the clouds are breakin
Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong yes I could I finally see the dawn arrivin

That she was keeping a secret fire
And if I got real close I'd burn

Just like a cat at night in the trees

That way that she liked her love to feel Your eyes got me dreaming

were all alone,rita coolidge,1978,
hollywood nights,bob seger  the silver bullet band,1978," She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
He was too far from home She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed And those Hollywood night
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
All those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of the skills He'd headed west 'cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights of LA
Wondering if he could ever go home And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
It was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
All those big city lights

deacon blues,steely dan,1978," This is the day of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line Learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues) My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love with those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home Learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues

I take one last drag as I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be I'll learn to work the saxophone

Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world

And I grew strong and I learned how to get along And so you're back from outer space

I should have made you leave your key

And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free

It ran one step ahead

'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again

Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees MacArthur Park's is melting in the dark

when youre in love with a beautiful woman,dr hook,1979," When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends
You know that it's crazy, you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem
Problem is that I've been fooled before By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies Everybody tempts her, everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes"

Will a little more love make it right? Where, where did my innocence go?
How, how was a young girl to know?

heart of glass,blondie,1979," Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind In between 'what I find is pleasing' and 'I'm feeling fine'
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind if I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do Once I had a love and it was a gas

dont cry out loud,melissa manchester,1979," Baby cried the day the circus came to town,
'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her.
So she painted on a smile and then took up with some clown,
While she danced without a net upon the wire.
I know a lot about her, 'cause you see,
Baby, is an awful lot like me. Don't cry out loud,
Just keep it inside,
And learn how to hide your feelings.
Fly high and proud.
And if you should fall,
Remember you almost had it all. Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down,
They left behind her dreams among the litter.
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found,
There was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter.
But Baby can't be broken, 'cause you see,
She had the finest teacher, that was me.
I told her: Don't cry out loud,
Just keep it inside,
And learn how to hide your feelings.
Fly high and proud.
And if you should fall,
Remember you almost had it all. Don't cry out loud,
Just keep it inside,
And learn how to hide your feelings.
Fly high and proud.
And if you should fall,
Remember you almost made it. Don't cry out loud,
Just keep it inside,
And learn how to hide your feelings.
Fly high and proud.
And if you should fall,
Remember you almost had it all."
the logical song,supertramp,1979," When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,
Oh joyfully, playfully watching me
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,
Logical, oh responsible, practical
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,
Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical There are times when all the world's asleep,
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am I said, watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,
Liberal, oh fanatical, criminal
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're Acceptable
Respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable!
Oh, take it take it yeah But at night, when all the world's asleep,
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am, who I am, who I am, who I am

after the love has gone,earth wind  fire,1979,
the gambler,kenny rogers,1979," On a warm summer's evenin'
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
Boredom overtook us
And he began to speak He said, ""Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"" So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
He said, ""If You're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right"" You got to know
When to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You never count your money When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done Every gambler knows
The secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep 'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep"" And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler - he broke even
And in his final words I found
An ace that I could keep You've got to know
When to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'

she believes in me,kenny rogers,1979," While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, find a way While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, while she waits
while she waits for me for me!"

the devil went down to georgia,the charlie daniels band,1979," ==================================================
Charlie Daniels - The Devil Went Down To Georgia
==================================================
One Way single (1991)
(original from Million Mile Reflections by the Charlie Daniels Band) 
The Devil went down to Georgia, he was looking for a soul to steal.
He was in a bind, 'cause he was way behind, he was willing to make a deal.
When he came across this young boy sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot.
Well the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump, said, ""Boy let me tell you what.
I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too,
Now if you care to make a dare, well I'll make a bet with you.
Now you play pretty good fiddle boy, but give the Devil his due,
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you."" The boy said, ""My name's Jonny and it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."" Jonny rosin up you bow and play your fiddle hard.
'cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.
And if you win you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you loose the Devil gets your soul. Hey! So the Devil opened up his case, said, ""I guess I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his finger tips as he rosined up his bow.
When he drew that bow across the strings, it made an evil hiss.
Then a band of demons joined in, it sounded something like this. So the Devil finished, Jonny said, ""Well you're pretty good old son.
Sit down in that chair out there, let me show you how it's done."" He played Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run.
The Devil's in the house with the rising sun,
Chicken in the breadpan picking out dough,
Granny does your dog bite, ""No, child, no."" So the Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
He laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Jonny's feet.
And Jonny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever want to try again,
'cause I've told you once, you son of a gun, I'm the best there's ever been."" He played Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run.
The Devil's in the house with the rising sun,
Chicken in the breadpan picking out dough
Granny does your dog bite, ""No, child, no.""

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing
And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole
And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"""

its still rock and roll to me,billy joel,1980," What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me. Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummell baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock & roll to me.
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me"
the rose,bette midler,1980," Some say love, it is a river That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, its only seed
It's the heart, afraid of breaking That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dying
That never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose"
escape the pi~na colada song,rupert holmes,1980," I was tired of my lady
We'd been together to long
Like a warn out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read
If you like pina colada's And gettin' caught in the rain
If your not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
I didn't think about my lady I know that sounds kinda mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad
Yes I like pina colada's And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called o'malley's
Where we'll plan our escape
So I waited with high hopes And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said oh its you
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said I never knew that you like pina colada's And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape
If you like pina colada And gettin' caught in the rain
If your not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
Yes I like pina colada's
Gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I got to meet you by tomorrow noon"

coward of the county,kenny rogers,1980," Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong.
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow,
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong. He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison;
I took care of Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son.
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy,
""Son my life is over, but yours has just begun"". ""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand,
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man."" There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky.
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, (and there was three of them). Tommy opened up the door, and saw Becky crying.
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand.
He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture.
As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again: ""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand,
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom;
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor.
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! old yeller's leaving,""
But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door. Twenty years of crawling were bottled up inside him.
He wasn't holding nothing back -- he let 'em have it all.
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing.
He said, ""This one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall. (And I heard him say,) ""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek,
And papa, I should hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man"". Everyone considered him the coward of the county."

I want the moment to start when I can fill your heart with
More love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey, now my love will be so sound
Gonna take about a hundred life times
To live it down, wear it down and tear it down This is no fiction, this is no act
This is real it's a fact
I'll always belong only to you
And each day I'll be living to, make sure I'm giving you
More love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey, now my love will be so sound
It'll take a hundred life times
To live it down, wear it down and tear it down
As we grow older no need to fear
'Cause when you need me I'll be here
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful and is keeping it youthful with
More love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey, now my love will be so sound
It'll take a hundred life times
To live it down, oh wear it down and tear it down I wanna give you more love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey, now my love will be so sound
Just to live it down, I wanna give you more love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy"

against the wind,bob seger and the silver bullet band,1980," Seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin low
And the secrets that we shared, mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
Til there was nothin left to burn and nothin left to prove And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then Against the wind
We were runnin against the wind
We were young and strong we were runnin against the wind And the years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I
Guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin to run and runnin to live
Never worried about payin or even how much I owe Movin' eight miles a minute and for months at a time
Breakin all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin
Searchin for shelter again and again Against the wind
Little somethin against the wind
I found myself seekin shelter against the wind Well those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out Against the wind
I'm still runnin against the wind
I'm older now but still runnin against the wind Well I'm older now but still runnin against the wind

And I wondered, too

Is that you love me still
And that you think
You'll be comin' home real soon

Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone
And I rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right Well, remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as they
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
I'ts too late to fight
I'ts too late to change me

Standing in the door Stay with me a while
I only wanna sing for you
We've traveled halfway 'round the world
To find ourselves again September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way Look at what you've done
Why? You've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room Look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way [Incomprehensible]
Me and you
I can still remember it all September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing the scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way September morn
We danced, we danced that night away, yes
Two lovers playing the scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way
September morning still can make me feel that way
September morning still can make me feel that way"
give me the night,george benson,1980," Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights 'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine
A little late romance It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world
Coming out to dance 'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly? Just give me the night
Give me the night 'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly? And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening
Taking us up high Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street
Until the morning light 'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night..."
broken hearted me,anne murray,1980," Every now and then I cry
Every night
You keep staying on my mind
All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again No, I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted me Every day is just the same
Playing games
Different lovers, different names
They keep saying I'll survive
It just takes time But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again No, I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart

And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are apart
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you cam along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shinin' soft in your eyes And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are apart

Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
Wall to wall,
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's fly
DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast,
Flash is cool
Francois sais pas, flashe' no do And you don't stop
Sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars
Where the people meet Face to face
Dance cheek to cheek
One to one
Man to man
Dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars He's eatin' bars, yeah, wall to wall
Door to door
Hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture
Be pure Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain
Paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said, ""Don't stop, do punk rock"" Well, now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop and you don't stop
Just blast off
Sure shot 'Cause the man from Mars
Stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby. Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away from me.
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
and it won't matter anyhow. If morning's echo says we've sinned
well, it was what I wanted now.
And if we're the victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light.
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby. Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me

Gave you my soul
You left me alone here With nothing to hold

How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you Then they really have you Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave,
Just get away
We all know the song You need what you need
You can say what you want Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold
When you love's on the rocks
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave

you couldn't tell That I'd been
Crying over you
Crying over you
Then you said to so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying.

That the touch of your hand
can start me crying I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true

While you don't love me
And I'll always be Crying over you

hearts,marty balin,1981," Is everything alright?
I just called to say
How lost I feel
without you
Miles away
I really can't believe I'm here
And how I still care about you. Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way. Is everything the same?
Do you ever think of me
And how we loved one another
Will you change your mind
Will you want me back again
Or have you found yourself a new lover? Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way. Is everything ok?
I just thought I'd write a song
To tell the world
How much I miss you
'Cause each and every day
I think of all the words I never said
And all the chances that I had to. Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be
Is everything alright?."

Through someone else's eyes And now it's my turn

At least I'll own today It's my turn

together,tierra,1981," De mi tierra bella, de mi tierra santa
oigo ese grito de los tambores y los timbales al cumbanchar.
Y ese pregón que canta un hermano, que de su tierra vive lejano
y que el recuerdo le hace llorar, una canción que vive entonando
de su dolor, de su propio llanto, y se le escucha penar. La Tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tú no estás.
La tierra te empuja de raíz y cal.
La tierra suspira si no te ve más. La tierra donde naciste no la puedes olvidar
porque tiene tus raíces y lo que dejas atrás. La Tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tú no estás. Siguen los pregones, la melancolía.
Y cada noche junto a la luna sigue el guajiro entonando el son.
Y cada calle que va a mi pueblo, tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
tiene nostalgia como su voz. Y esa canción que sigue entonando
corre en la sangre y sigue llegando con más fuerza al corazón. La Tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tú no estás. ***Extra lyrics- remix ***
La tierra se siente entera, se siente con ansiedad
Es el alma que la sueña y que no puede olvidar, tú ves. La Tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tú no estás. Tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
Nunca la olvido, la llevo en mi sentimiento, ¡sí señor!.
Oigo ese grito, vive el recuerdo
Corre en mi sangre, la llevo por dentro ¡cómo no!
Canto de mi tierra bella y santa, sufro ese dolor que hay en su alma.
Aunque está lejos yo la siento, y un día regreso, yo lo sé.
Siguen los pregones, la melancolía.
Y cada noche junto a la luna sigue el guajiro entonando el son.
Y cada calle que va a mi pueblo, tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
la nostalgia de su voz. Me jega con fuerza el corazon.
La Tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tú no estás.
La tierra te empuja de raíz y cal.
La tierra suspira si no te ve más."

while you see a chance,steve winwood,1981," Stand up in a clear blue morning Until you see
What can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free
Can you be
When some cold tomorrow finds you When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you
While you see a chance Take it
Find romance
Fake it
Because it's all on you
Don't you know by now No one gives you anything
And don't you wonder
How you keep on moving
One more day
Your way
Go your way
When there's no one left to leave you Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you
While you see a chance Take it
Find romance
Fake it
Because it's all on you
Stand up in a clear blue morning Until you see
What can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free
Can you be
And that old grey wind is blowing And there's nothing left worth knowing
And it's time you should be going
While you see a chance Take it
Find romance
Fake it
Because it's all on you
While you see a chance Take it

All those years ago I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago All those years ago All those years ago Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago You had control of our smiles and our tears

same old lang syne,dan fogelberg,1981," Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another 'auld lang syne' The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain"

I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade 'Cause when I chased my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say I made it through the rain

Got rained on too

She's a modern girl who's been though this movie before She don't build her world 'round no single man
But she's gettin' by, doin' what she can
She is free to be, what she wants to be
'N all what she wants to be, is a modern girl
Na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na, she's a modern girl It looks like rain again, she takes a train again
She's on her way again through London town
Where she keeps a tangerine, flicks through a magazine
Until it's time to leave her dreams on the underground
She walks to the office like everyone else
An independent lady, takin' care of herself She's been dreaming 'bout it all day long
As soon as she gets home, it's him on the telephone
He asks her to dinner, she says I'm not free
Tonight I'm going to stay at home and watch my TV I don't build my world 'round no single man
But I'm gettin' by, doin' what I can
I am free to be, what I want to be

seven year ache,rosanne cash,1981," You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way Girls in the bars thinking who is this guy
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full Tell me you're trying to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
Boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God, I hope he comes back soon"" And everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown There's plenty of dives to be someone you're not
Just say you're looking for something you might have forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home Just tell 'em your trying to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
Boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God, I hope he comes back soon""
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven year ache

Time it goes on waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Livin' and breathin' and some misbelievin'
But I can't hold you woman, no piece of you
You were the magic, my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistakin'
But I'll follow you woman, eternally
You were the magic, my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love (break) Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in makin' love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in makin' love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up

eye of the tiger,survivor,1982," Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain Years go by I'm lookin' through
A girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in between My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold) (My blood runs cold)
Ooh My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold) Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
(Aah)
Before she caught my eye I was shakin' in my shoes
(Aah)
Whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me
(Aah)
When angel passed close by Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much (My blood runs cold)
Yeah my memory has just been sold

I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on Take you car, yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it (My blood runs cold)
