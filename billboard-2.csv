I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around
So I knock at the door
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor
So I went in Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone
I'm not being mean
Her Parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
we were just doing things young people in love do Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on Can you fill me in
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say hey girl, come on right around
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down down down to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leaving So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it cause you felt cold
I'm not being mean I didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools
We were just doing things young people end up doing
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in
(Can you fill me in)
All they seem to do
Is be checking up on you
Baby
(Craig David)
Watching our every move
Think some day they might approve
Baby
Why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black

It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you I don't care if that's not fair
Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call
You leave me here, with nothing at all There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
Theres times I dont believe its right, I know it, know it Don't make me promises
Baby you never did know how to keep them well I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell
Cause I want it all or nothing at all

When you reach the bottom, it's now or never

You leave me here, with nothing at all

Could lose it all if you've got no more room
nowhere, inside, for me in your life

The flow of the century. oh it's timeless. HOV'!
Thanks for comin out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that. uuunnnh. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch! H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA

That's the anthem get'cha damn hands UP! Holla at me...
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks Yeah...
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggaz actin like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
so hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great

'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house So I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses, goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk they would have nothing to tell So what could it be?
Is there someone imitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong when I say There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be
Who you say you are, you gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a
(Stranger in my house) Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me?
Have I changed so drasticly?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the same (There's a stranger in my house)
(It took a while to figure out)
It took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house (There's a stranger in my house)
(It took a while to figure out)
Took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
He wouldn't touch me like that

He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me

I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire, I know I meant to say no But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable

That I should really say goodnight
But I cant stop myself from falling (falling)

It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So if you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I ... CHORUS:
Heard it all before (heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
Baby this, Baby that
But your lies ain't working out
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (down)

I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did yes I did
But your lies ain't working out (look who's hurting now)
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Got me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do
And there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out
I am no longer concerned
See I... Heard it all before (heard it all before)
Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think, that's what you said to me

But your lies ain't working out look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down Use to hang on to your every word
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt
The things you use to say would sound so sweet

But your lies ain't working out look who's hurting now

the space between,dave matthews band,2001," You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain But will I hold you again These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain But will I hold you again
Will I hold Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down The space between
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room The space between
our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time The space between"

turn off the light,nelly furtado,2001," It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me I'm better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
till' you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
I looked above the other day Cuz I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some
I'm searching for things that I just cannot see Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, I can see, why can't you see it's all in me Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need
Follow me down, follow me down down down,
I do not need I do not need nobody
Where is your logic

im already there,lonestar,2001," He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

beautiful day,u2,2001," The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
And you feel like it's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
A beautiful day Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
You don't need it now, you don't need it now

He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got If you're callin' 'bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got somethin' to sell, you're wastin' your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone,
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin, I still love you The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days, and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say,
But she heard three rings and then If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. If this is Austin, I still love you Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evenin'
And this is what he heard If you're callin' 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong
And by the way, boy, this is no machine you're talkin' to
Can't you tell, this is Austin, and I still love you I still love you"

Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face

And they wore everything they own, livin' in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry Keep having this dream about my old man
I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand
We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around
So many things I wanna say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it's up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
I haven't had my story yet. And everything weighin' on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says,
I love you dad I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

who i am,jessica andrews,2001," If I live to be a hundred

that'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am So when I make a big mistake
When I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowin'
I will be just fine
'Cause nothin' changes who I am I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

And that's who I am I'm a saint and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable

dont happen twice,kenny chesney,2001," I haven't seen you in forever,
aw you haven't changed a bit.
you didn't think that I remembered,
how could I forget? We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
made a wish on every star
in that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
for the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice. To this day I still taste that first kiss.
How I prayed it wouldn't end,
and in a way seeing you like this
I guess it never really did. We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
made a wish on every star
in that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
for the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice. One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
for the first time in my life

yeah we fell in love"
one more day,diamond rio,2001," Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished, for one more day with you. One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishin' still, for one more day with you.
One more day. First thing I'd do, is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone And keep the tv off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do, with one more day with you.
One more day
One more time One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishin' still, for one more day with you.
One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishin' still, for one more day
Leave me wishin' still for one more day
Leave me wishin' still for one more day
With you.
One more day..."
i wish,r kelly,2001," I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ghetto America Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say, what's up?
And let you know your baby boy ain't doin' so tough
Even though you passed, goin' on four long years
Still wakin' up late at night cryin' tears
Just thinkin' about those days you used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember, we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin' Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now, I'm just missing you How I wish, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know, I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay And if I make it out, this thug life
See you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ever since this money come, it's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, boy, you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin' this real shit off like a gun
I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a Bentley and a house That's why fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits And fake-ass players get a real player hatin 'em
'Honey Love' goes platinum and y'all ass come round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is goin' down
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
And how I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends With you
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
See you again someday I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
Voices in my head been tellin' me to come to church
Say, the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreamin' of windows, black-tinted like a hearse
But wakin' up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world, I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin' Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you
And how I'd go to church on Easter Sunday With you Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you

its a great day to be alive,travis tritt,2001," I got rice cooking in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say
Hey I'm doing alright Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
Feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced
No I'm just doin' alright And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good? Oh, yeah It's been fifteen years since I left home
Said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Give it my best and then I left it alone
Oh, I hope they're doin' alright Now I look in the mirror and what do I see?
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good? Sometimes it's lonely
Sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room Sometimes I'm fallin'
Desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good? It's a great day to be alive

wherever you will go,the calling,2002," So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own? If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind I'll stay with you for all of time
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go

in the end,linkin park,2002," It starts with
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

whats luv,fat joe featuring ashanti,2002,
u got it bad,usher,2002," Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who
Makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew Said you act like you ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past
You wanna let it go I been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when You stuck in the house you don't wanna have fun
'Cos all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else
You got it bad When you say that you love 'em
And you really know everything
That used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money all my cars You can have it all and
Flowers, cards and candy I do it just 'cos
I said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know I really adore you All my people know what's going on
Look at your mate help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man
You're my girl I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies, say I'm your girl
You're my man
Promise to love you the best I can See I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Every one of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when You stuck in the house you don't wanna have fun
'Cos all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when
You stuck in the house you don't wanna have fun

You got it bad when you're out with someone"
blurry,puddle of mudd,2002," Everything's so blurry
And everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty
And everything is so messed up
Preoccupied without you
I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you
I stumble then I crawl You could be my someone
You could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you
From all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing
Imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us
But that's not very far Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well you shoved it in my face Everyone is changing
There's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending
And let me know just how you feel
Cause I am lost without you
I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you
I stumble then I crawl And you could be my someone
You could be my scene

always on time,ja rule featuring ashanti,2002," (Ashanti)
Always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), always on time
Gave you my... baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my... baby (Chorus - Ashanti)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine (Ja Rule)
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care (Chorus)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine (Ja Rule)
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share [with Ashanti] somethin so rare, but who cares, you care (Chorus)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine (Ja Rule)
Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti] But who cares, you care (Chorus)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine (Ashanti) Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my... baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my... baby be mine (Radio Announcer)

Guess who's back, guess who's back

'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie! Now this looks like a job for me

Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch!
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me?
Well I'm back

Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter

Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please

No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy

I've wasted my time
You can't
Stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all again

When did our light turn from green to red?
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again Well this is

one last breath,creed,2002," Please come now, I think I'm falling
But I'm holding on to all
I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say, let me say Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet Ain't so far down I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought
I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace I cried out, ""Heaven, save me""
But I'm down to one last breath And with it let me say, let me say
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet Ain't so far down
I'm so far down Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's
Something left for me
So, please, come stay with me 'Cause I still believe there's
Something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

whenever wherever,shakira,2002," Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody Ledo lo le lo le, ledo lo le lo le
Can't you see?
I'm at your feet Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear There over, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave, will cry a river Ledo lo le lo le, ledo lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear There over, hereunder
Or up above, don't wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear Ledo lo le lo le, ledo lo le lo le
Think out loud
Say it again Ledo lo le lo le lo la
Tell me one more time
That you'll live, lost in my eyes Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear There over, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near

im gonna be alright,jennifer lopez featuring nas,2002," Oh yes
Yes I did baby, yes I did It's funny 'cause for a while I walked around with a smile

Don't you know it's not for you? I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away 'cause I love you, I just tried to stay I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it

Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, ""I'm gonna be alright"" Friends of mine say to me, they say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part, I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you? You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do, now I realize that I can't change you I used to say, I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, ""I'm gonna be alright"" Said, ""I wouldn't walk away"", somedays I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true, me livin' without you
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it

oops oh my,tweet featuring missy elliott,2002," *verse 1*
Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From the start it, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath *chorus*
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be? *verse 2*
I tried and I tried to avoid
but this thing was happening
Swallow my pride
Let it ride and party
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath *chorus*
OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my

a moment like this,kelly clarkson,2002," What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling
We've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment Like this Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender
I can't explain
Well I may be dreaming
But till I awake Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment
Like this Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this Some people wait a lifetime for a moment
Like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment
Like this
Oh like this

Some people wait a lifetime

addictive,truth hurts featuring rakim,2002," (Verse 1: Truth Hurts)
He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, ok
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream (Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady (Verse 2: Truth Hurts)
Oh! Tonight he's waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm takin, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I got (Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady (Verse 3: Rakim)
Thinkin of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands
We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out
Just me and you high off sex I'm twisted
You OG'd and you OD addicted (Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady"

no such thing,john mayer,2002," Welcome to the real world
She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above So the good boys and girls
Take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and maybe transfers They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories tiny tragedies They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"

I just can't get you out of my head, boy,

Stay forever and ever and ever and ever. I just can't get you out of my head, boy,

superman its not easy,five for fighting,2002," I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
I'm just out to find
The better part of me I'm more than a bird,
I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
It's not easy to be me
I wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see
It may sound absurd but don't be naïve Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed but won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me
Up, up and away, away from me
Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything
I can't stand to fly I'm not that naïve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for kryptonite on this one way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me
Inside of me, inside of me yeah Inside of me, inside of me
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man looking for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy.
It's not easy to be me."
cleanin out my closet,eminem,2002," load ""Cleanin Out My Clos..."" Ringtone ""Cleanin Out My Closet"" Where's my snare? I have no snare in my headphones - there you go
Yeah... yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show"" I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet
I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet"

lose yourself,eminem,2002," Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

What about, what about, what about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us? Thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say?
Said that you'd love only me
Thought that you'd be all I need
What happened to promises?
Said that you were a better man
You're words have no weight with me
'Cause you're counterfeit I see I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with this any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity
I will be just fine if you decide
That you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what: What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made me?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about, what about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us? Baby see if you can peep this
Now what if I said you wasn't fit to be with?
And what if I told you the game we play I picked it?
And what if I said it wasn't true so do you?
You and I know without me there's no you
So what about bills that were past due, paid for you
All you say to me is baby I owe you
Forget about the brand new life that I gave you
So what about us to me?
So what about us to me?
What about us? What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?

What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you said?

underneath your clothes,shakira,2002," You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes
Is where I find them Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey 'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a... I love you more than all that's on the planet
Moving, talking, walking, breathing
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey Underneath your clothes
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl"

And a few shots away from dyin'

(Angie M) Uh, woo! come on, uh
(Lil' Mo) If I can go, with you
(Angie M) Yo, yo, uh (Verse 1: Angie Martinez)
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is (Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away (Verse 2: Sacario)
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you (Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away (Martinez Angie)
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy? (Sacario)
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak (Angie+S)
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few (Sacario)
Go 'head (Martinez Angie)
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo? (Sacario)
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too (Martinez Angie)
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue (Sacario)
And the shop's there? (Martinez Angie)
If they don't got em, they don't make em ((Sacario:) True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask (Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say

the whole world,outkast featuring killer mike,2002," Okay, here we go
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song
And I want y'all to sing along, sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny, day
When it's rainin' inside
And you're, all alone, all alone, yeah
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
Take a little trip, hater, pack up yo' mind
Look forward, not behind then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought, he could rhyme
Now, if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use
Abbreviation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See, ain't nuttin' changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin'
Hair with stylin' gel in it, throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote
And this for dem niggaz workin' at the airport
Who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole, world, world
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look, how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat runnin' like Randy Moss
Ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gatherin' no moss
Mami, I'm comin', I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac, Outkast just won't stop
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom, medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now, even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's persuable
Doing God's willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself
Dre set it on the right and I'll set it on the left 'cause
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues

underneath it all,no doubt featuring lady saw,2002," There's times when I want something more

Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all

And you need some discipline
But lately you've been tryin' real hard
And givin' me your best And
You give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad You're really lovely

And you make me better
Better, better For real
'Cause underneath it all,
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
Oh no, you're good for me baby Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness

caramel,city high featuring eve,2002," Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hoping to die
She said-nigga I know about pain cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life Hold up!
What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby you can do it What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now

I'm not the one you should fear
What do you got to move you darling
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all And I want to get free
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be all you need
Somehow here is gone I have no solution
To the sound of this pollution in me
And I was not the answer
So forget you ever thought it was me I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
What do you got to move you darling

drive for daddy gene,alan jackson,2002," It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was feet, from the bow to stern light
Secondhand, from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy, when he went there to get her We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood, will never be forgoten It was, just an old plywood boat
With a Johnson
With electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"" Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When daddy let me
Drive Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new, in '
Daddy got it right, 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves, and he had it going He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
And I would press that clutch
And I would, keep it right
He'd say, ""a little slower son; you're doing just fine"" Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When daddy let me
Drive I'm grown up now
Three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it, made me feel
And he'd say turn it left
And steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When daddy let me
Drive Daddy let me drive Oh he let me, drive It's just an old plywood boat

The way, you turned around and looked at me it seemed as though
You must have somehow felt me starin' on the low
Somethin' tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye

Must be a full moon, feel like one of those nights Why, is this the first time that I'm seein' you around
Could you be visiting or are you new in town?
Yeah, whatever the case, I'm feelin' you right here and right now
Your smile, and all the love you showin' lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of somethin' special
Happy that I met you I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like

Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun... A new day has come A new day has ... come

They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
till' you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
I looked above the other day Cuz I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some
I'm searching for things that I just cannot see Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, I can see, why can't you see it's all in me Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need

living and living well,george strait,2002," Had a nice little life
A little boat, a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew. There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well. 'Til you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish, caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet. There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well. My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you. There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in livin'.
I thought I was living.
There's a difference in living and living well."

None of this would have happened

You wouldn't have been successful, and
If it weren't for me
You would never have amounted to very much Ooh this could be messy, but
You don't seem to mind

Overlook this supposed crime We'll fast-forward to a few years later

And I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of protégé

I know you depend on me

I know how you sexualize me
Like a young thing would and I think I like it Ooh this could get messy, but
Ooh, you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody

No one knows except the both of us
I've more than honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious? Just make sure you don't tell on me
Especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves
And not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world
'Cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done-up properly
I might want to marry you one day
If you'd watch that weight and keep your firm body Ooh this could be messy

sk8er boi,avril lavigne,2002," He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say? He wanted her
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth Five years from now
She sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on TV
Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV She calls up her friends
They already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth? He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth? Sorry girl but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each others world I'm with the skater boy
I said see you later boy
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
I'm with the skater boy

Getting there the hard way Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I'm gonna be a star Now me and Deliah
Singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
Listen to the radio to hear what's cooking

They got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank

And it ain't coming back I said a long time gone

where were you when the world stopped turning,alan jackson,2002," Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day
Out in the yard with your wife and children
Working on some stage in LA
Did you stand there in shock at the site of
That black smoke rising against that blue sky
Did you shout out in anger
In fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry Did you weep for the children
Who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below Did you burst out in pride
For the red white and blue
The heroes who died just doing what they do
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself to what really matters I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Driving down some cold interstate
Did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her
Did you dust off that bible at home
Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Speak with some stranger on the street
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger
Stand in line and give your own blood
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young

when im gone,3 doors down,2003," There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
Somewhere in this darkness there's a light that I can't find
Or maybe it's too far away
Or maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am
and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends
And roaming through this darkness I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am
and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So hold me when I'm here

But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be, me I'm talkin' to myself in public, dodging glances on the train
And I know, I know they've all been talkin' about me
I can hear them whisper, and it makes me think
There must be somethin' wrong with me

bring me to life,evanescence featuring paul mccoy,2003," How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb

Until you find it there and lead it back home (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)

Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become Bring me to life

Bring me to life Frozen inside without your touch, without your love
Darling, only you are the life among the dead All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here (there must be something more)
Bring me to life (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)

where is the love,the black eyed peas,2003," What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek? Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love) Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong? Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek? Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love) Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love, the love, the love? I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love? Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? Sing with me y'all:
One world, one world (We only got)
One world, one world (That's all we got)
One world, one world
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah
We only got
(One world, one world)
That's all we got
(One world, one world)"
the game of love,santana featuring michelle branch,2003,
lose yourself,eminem,2003," Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better You can do anything you set your mind to, man"

03 bonnie  clyde,jayz featuring beyonce,2003," Ah
Potrei cantare mille volte ancora ma Forse sarebbe tutto inutile.
Sognavo i palchi tra i banchi di scuola (ah)
Forse non sono più idee stupide.
Chiedo aiuto al cielo quando sono solo
Prego, io non ho più la voglia
Voglio una vita diversa da questa
A quanto pare fare il salto ti porta a cadere giù
Prima guardami bambina lo vedi che
Sono alle strette baby
Guardo 'sti grattacieli ti vedo tra le stelle
Io qui da solo tra i marciapiedi
E non ho soldi veri per venire fino lì da te che
Mi aspetti sola da tempo ancora per quel caffè e.
Meno male che c'è ancora qualcuno che crede in me
Vorrei parlarti dei miei guai fanno paura a me
Dirti di quello che non sai parlarne un po' con te Non siamo più io e te Io sono solo e...
E' ora che facciamo i seri dai Qua passa il tempo e tu non passi mai
Moriamo insieme come Bonny e Clyde Prendimi la mano scappiamo con tutti contro che
Ogni cosa che faccio poi la fai anche te
Ogni giorno mi sveglio e mi rendo conto che
Che io vinca o che perda lo faccio insieme a te
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e.
Io e te, come Bonny e Clyde
Come sempre mai
Come skinny e Nike Air baby
Oggi sei qui, domani boh, dopodomani preghi che ritorni
La distanza è come una pioggia di vetri Questa sera suono devo distruggere il club
Tu che sai chi sono pure al di fuori del rap
L'amore non si può comprare con la golden card Vieni qui fai piano, capisci ci sono i miei di là
La musica che ci lega, tu che mi stai dietro prega
Che se poi cadiamo speriamo che nessuno ci veda
Andiamo anche se so che è tardi Ma che ne sanno gli altri
Di tutto quello che ho passato senza lamentarmi
Senza mai distrarmi, puntando sempre più in alto
Vola nero, vola in cielo, vola
Buttati ch'è il tuo momento, che il nostro momento
Io e te, Bonny e Clyde
E' ora che facciamo i seri dai
Qua passa il tempo e tu non passi mai Moriamo insieme come Bonny e Clyde
Prendimi la mano scappiamo con tutti contro che
Ogni cosa che faccio poi la fai anche te
Ogni giorno mi sveglio e mi rendo conto che
Che io vinca o che perda lo faccio insieme a te
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e."

The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases

I need my Tim sound right, left Izzy kizzy looky here Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lift a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome Got bitches in the kitchen Never home alone And he's on the grind Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud like Timmy
Uh had to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap get my head sucked right
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the right
You drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton
Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real

Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'll never, ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love What is this feeling taking over? no!
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true
Misguided heart
Miss play it smart Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing a misconception
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love
What is this feeling taking over? no!
Thinking no one could open the door Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid? It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I've finally seen
What is this feeling taking over? no!
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?

And what kind of God would serve this
We will cure this dirty old disease Well, if you you've got the poison, I've got the remedy
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison

The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends

Say, I won't worry my life away Well, I heard two men, talking on the radio
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
Or they were counting down the ways to stab
The brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh death-breath
Is sure to outlast this catastrophe dance with me Well, if you've got the poison and baby I'm your remedy

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin Cocaine sniffing up drugs all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'm a tell you how
Put your hands in the air and take a vow I know I can

Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night

(I'll be where I wanna be) Be, be'fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian, Arabs and gave them gold when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot off they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see? If the truth is told, the youth can grow
Then learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my queen"" I know I can

If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all
I'll never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms"

Workday passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
Gettin' paid by the hour and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him something
I think I'll just call it a day Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere Well this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
Half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone's for me
You can tell them I just sailed away And pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere I could pay off my tab
Pour myself in a cab
And be back to work by two
At a moment like this
I can't help but wonder:
What would Jimmy Buffett do? 
[(Jimmy Buffett enters)]
""Funny you should ask, Alan I'd say, pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane, before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care"" (he don't care) If I don't care
It's Five O'Clock somewhere ""What time zone am I on?
What Country am I in?"" It don't matter it's Five O'Clock somewhere ""It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it"" I heard that ""You've been there haven't you?"" Yes sir ""I've seen your boat there"" I've been to Margaritaville a few times ""Alright, well that's good"" Stumbled my way back ""OK we just want to make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons"" Between the buoys, I got it ""Alright, well it's five o'clock let's go somewhere"" I'm ready, crank it up ""Lets get out of here"" I'm gone"

Yeah, oh, yeah The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch and this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of glowing sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung
My blessings are in front of me, it's not about the land
I'll never beat the view from my front porch looking in There's a carrot top who can barely walk with a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them
And the view I love the most is my front porch looking in, yeah I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me
'Cause anywhere I'll ever go and everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away like my front porch looking in There's a carrot top who can barely walk with a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most is my front porch looking in, oh, yeah I see what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in, not when I'm looking out There's a carrot top who can barely walk with a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most is my front porch looking in, yeah Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk

Left without a word,

When I was the one,
Who gave you, my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you
No oh-oh

Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (is cry)
God send me an Angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes And I, know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still loved you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one, that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
My heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
Sooo... God God send me an Angel
From the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (All I do is cry)
God send me an Angel, (Send me an Angel) to wipe the tears from my eyes Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please
To se-end you-ou back to me
I couldn't eat
I couldn't sleep
And you made me feel like I could not breathe
When I...
All I wanted to do
Was feel your touch
And to give you all of my love but you
Took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now
But, you can't have it
Oh God! God send me an Angel (Send me an Angel) from the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart

Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two

Never thought
I'd be the one who would slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling pain, no In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought
I'd be the one who would slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she

Kate Moss can't find a job
In a world of post modern fad
What was good now is bad It's not hard to understand
Just follow this simple plan Follow your heart
Your intuition
It will lead you in the right direction
Let go of your mind
Your Intuition
It's easy to find
Just follow your heart baby You look at me
but you're not quite sure
Am I it or could you get more?
You learn cool from magazines
You learn love from Charlie Sheen If you want me let me know
I promise I won't say no You got something that you want me to sell
Sell your sin. Just cash in.
You got something that you want me to tell
You'll love me. Wait and see. If you want me

fighter,christina aguilera,2003," Humm, After all that you put me through,
You think I'd despise you,
But in the end I wanna thank you,
'Cause you've made me that much stronger. Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames 'cause your greed sold me out in shame After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know
Just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you
'Cause it Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a Fighter Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a Fighter. Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh,
Ooh Yeah, Ahh Uhuh Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game
I heard you're going round playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies 'cause you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore, no more,
It's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you
'Cause it Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a Fighter. Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a Fighter. How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretend not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
YOU-WON'T-STOP-ME I am a Fighter and I
(I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
(I've had enough) Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a Fighter Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a Fighter You thought I would forget
But I remembered
'Cause I remembered
I remembered
You thought I would forget

thugz mansion,2pac,2003," Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would of tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion' Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy. Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
for multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
the deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy. Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion' Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy."

Come back and take you home

What was I thinkin'? She snuck out one night an' met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out a-wavin' that 12-guage
We tore out the drive, he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'? Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late 'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
An' I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin', where the night might lead I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'?
What was I thinkin'? By the county line, the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road an' kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights an' tore through a cornfield
What was I thinkin'? At the other side, she was hollerin', ""Faster""
Took a dirt road, had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky-tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'? Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late 'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin', where the night might lead I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'?
What was I thinkin'? When a mountain of a man with a ""Born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in, I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside, hood slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'? I finally got her home at a half past two, later
Daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin'? Oh, what was I thinkin'?
Oh, what was I thinkin'? Then she gave a ""Come an' get me"" grin
An' like a bullet, we were gone again
'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin' where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'

flying without wings,ruben studdard,2003," Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You have found that special thing
You're flying without wings So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete But for me, it's waking up beside you, yeah
To watch the sun rise on your face
To know that I can say ""I love you""
At any given time or place It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine, all mine
And it's the flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings
I'm flying without wings"
sing for the moment,eminem,2003," These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his fucking dad walking out
Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back
Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standing on corners and porches just rapping
To having a fortune, no more kissing ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listening to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"
have you forgotten,darryl worley,2003," (Darryl Worley/Wynn Varble) I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start your preaching let me ask you this my friend Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten? They took all the footage off my T.V.
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away 
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten? I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Some went down like heros in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost and those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about bin Laden
Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?"
no shoes no shirt no problems,kenny chesney,2003," I've been up to my neck, working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles, of the shoes on my feet

Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom

Wanna look through my shades, and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for awhile, and lay back low

dont know why,norah jones,2003," I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching tear-drops in my hand My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come

She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore Whoa, whoa, whoa I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore Whoa, whoa, whoa I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right

To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear I've found out a reason for me
To change who I used to be

My Goodies, My Goodies, My Goodies
Not my goodies! [Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I got a sick reputation for handlin broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more.
And in my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin back
So you can put a car right thur
I'm the truth
And ain't got nothin' to prove.
An you can ask anybody
'cause they seen me do it.
Barracades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em.
Throw all the dirt you want it's no use.
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back pickin' out baskets of fruit.
(I love you boo)
Yeah freaky Petey love you too.
Ha Ha
You know how I do it.. [Verse 2: Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm
Just a young girl
But I'm not
just a young girl.
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for:
Sexy, independent, down to spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein too dramatic that's way I gotta have it. [Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies.

Got you all hot and bothered.
Mad 'cause I talk about it.

Just because you drive a Benz

You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie.
And still I'm sexy, independent
I have waited so you already know.
I'm not bein too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it
You think you're slick
Tryna hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein too dramatic it's just how I gotta have it [Chorus]
I bet you want the goodies.
Bet you thought about it.
Got you all hot and bothered.
Mad 'cause I talk about it.
Lookin for the goodies

And I ain't quite there yet but I'm gettin' better at it.

lean back,terror squad,2004," I don't give a 'bout your fault or mishappenin's
We from the Bronx, New York thing happens
Kids clappin' love to spark the place
Half the on the Squad got a scar on they face
It's a cold world, and this is ice half a mil' for the charm, this is life Got the phantom in front of the building Trinity Ave
10 years been legit they still figure me bad
As a youngin', was too much to cope with
Why you think, B-X nick-named me, Cook Coke Should've been called Don, robbery, extorsion or maybe grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, on some flow Joe fat with shotty was the logo kid. Said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now, lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back R to the Ezzy, M to the whizz-I, my arms stay breezy
The Don's stay flizz-I, got a date at 8, I'm in a 740'fizz-I've
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion My Squad in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission, and bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors and there really Ain't a need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor
Reckless, check it, said it, like my necklace, started relaxin'
Now, that's what the hell I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thing, we still the same, flows just changed
Now, we 'bout to change the game Said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now, lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back Now we livin' better now, Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now
See haters get tight, when you worth some millions
That's why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelin's Your can find Joe Crack at all type of
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and
If I would've brought Compton, they'd prolly squeel
'Cause half these rappers dead broke like dirick fa' real If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you
These even made gang signs commercials
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up Kay keep tellin' me to speak about da Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about da Rucker
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My champ Pee didn't have to play to win the championship My don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

here without you,3 doors down,2004," A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me, yeah. The miles just keep rollin'
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go, oh, yeah, yeah I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, its only you and me Everything I know, and anywhere I go (oh whoa)
It gets hard but it won't take away my love (oh whoa)
And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done It gets hard but it wont take away my love, whoa, oh, oh
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

my immortal,evanescence,2004," I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

Just answer your phone whenever I call
'Coz I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile I need a lady on the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook 'coz a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy

Maybe we can spend some time

Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you

Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, 'cause I'm straight with the Roc If you feeling like a pimp

Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em

In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve

I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real If you feeling like a pimp

Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'

Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
yeah
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die

(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold

I got that fire in my soul I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
And it's keeping me alive

I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time Yeah, and I don't like talking to strangers
So get the fuck off me I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool but I may just go ape shit
Say ""fuck y'all"" to all of y'all faces

Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here cause I'm sick with it cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it tell me now, isn't it funny? nah Oh, it's just me, myself and I

How could you ever be so cold? To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy, you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone (So now after all I've said and done) Maybe I'm the one to blame but (To think that you could be the one)
Well, it didn't work out that way Get out! (Leave) Right now
It's the end of you and me It's too late (Now)
And I can't wait for you to be gone (You to be gone) 'Cause I know
About her (Who?)
And I wonder (Why?) How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste of time (Waste of time)
I wanted you right here with me
But I have no choice, you gotta leave
Because my heart is breakin'
With every word I'm sayin'
I gave up everything I had
On something that just wouldn't last But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these
Eyes... ohhh ohhh
Get out!
Get out! (Leave)
Right now
It's the end of you and me (You and me)
It's too late (Now)
And I can't wait for you to be gone 'cause I know
About her (Who?)

Get out! (Leave)

It's the end of you and me (Hey yeah)
It's too late (Now)
And I can't wait for you to be gone 'cause I know
About her (Who?)
And I wonder (Why?)
How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste of time (Waste of time)
Get out! (Leave)
You and me
It's too late (Too late) (You)
About her (Who? Why?)
You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste of time"

Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me Cuz' I start thinkin' about it

To know when it feels right Cuz' with you

But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin is your hair
Yeah, I'm ridin with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists gettin wrong deals

walked outta heaven,jagged edge,2004," I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking God to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing He gave to me
I see everything clearer now The nights as black as, black as it's ever been
With out my girl I'ma lose it
And I pray that He just shed's his grace on me
I need just to be back with my baby Feels like I just walked right outta heaven
Feels like I done damn near thrown my life away, hey
I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven
I don't know what to do, to get back right with you Feel like I just walked right outta heaven
Feel like I done damn near thrown my life away, hey yeah
Like child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, feels like I just walked
Right outta heaven See my Mama told me that if it's meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
And the best thing I can do is to just let her, let her go
I know, I don't wanna do it But if I continue to push she'll just pull away
And I know that in my heart it's a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated
And I hope that she's not gone for good, no no no Feels like I just walked right outta heaven
Feels like I done damn near thrown my life away, hey
I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven
And I don't know what to do, to get back right with you Feel like I just walked right outta heaven
Feel like I done damn near thrown my life away, hey yeah
Like child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, feels like I just walked
Right outta heaven Craving For you all the time
Suppose to move on with my life
Girl I tried and I tried
Feel like I can't walk I feel like I can't talk, girl
I don't know what to do, to get back right with you
I feel like I just walked outta heaven, baby
If you ever loved somebody And if you ever had somebody
But you know that you hurt that somebody

through the wire,kanye west,2004," Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation, man Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town what's going on
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork How do you console my mom or give her light support Telling her, her sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I've been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making man I really apologize how I sound right now man
If this ain't clear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said like six weeks You know we had reconstru...
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was missing from half my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man This is what I gotta say right here dawg
Yeah, turn me up yeah
Uh What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire You know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um
I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
You can't be serious man"

breaking the habit,linkin park,2004," Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habits
I'm breaking the habits
Tonight (...)
Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habits
I'm breaking the habits
Tonight
I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habits
I'm breaking the habits

live like you were dying,tim mcgraw,2004," He said I was in my early forties, with a lot of life before me
And one moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, looking at the x-rays
Talking bout' the options and talking bout' sweet times.
I asked him when it sank in, that this might really be the real end
How's it hit 'cha when you get that kind of news?
Man what did ya do?
He said I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denyin'
And he said some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin' He said I was finally the husband, that most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend, a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin, wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book, and I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Shu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denyin'
And he said some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin' Like tomorrow was the end
And ya got eternity to think about what to do with it
What should you do with it
What can I do with it
What would I do with it Skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And man I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flyin'
And he said some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'"
remember when,alan jackson,2004," Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when
Remember when

Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me? Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings

You in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy And every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings

I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away And every time I try to fly I fall

wanna get to know you,gunit featuring joe,2004," I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizin' my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi, then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feelin' like, 'maybe she the wrong woman'
Think I'ma be chasin' the chicken head, you on somethin'
Your toes painted, half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Make the decision, Shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home, I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on
Holla at yo boy I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy Bitches be frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoyin' from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruisin' after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with a frame and to make her feel special
I let her call me by my governor name
Her panties wet over fame fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your homie I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy Yeah now, what would fuck me up more watchin' her lick her lips
Or watchin' her walk, she hypnotize me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right
Look I'm legit now, used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours
Big house, big Benz, girl, its yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause there be some honeys gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here, let my touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night, we can have a balla night I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby

I really wanna fuck you, baby

dont tell me,avril lavigne,2004," You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss?
It was something like this and made me go ooh ooh
You wiped my tears, got rid all of my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love, guys are so hard to trust Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl the one who gives it all away, yeah Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah ...
Don't think that you're charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
I got you in my pants, I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop
Thought I liked you a lot but I'm really upset (Really upset)
Get out of my head, get off of my bed yeah, that's what I said
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl the one who throws it all away ...
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah
This guilt trip that you put me on won't mess me up, I've done no wrong Any thoughts of you and me have gone away
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah (Better off that way)
I'm better off alone anyway"
youll think of me,keith urban,2004," I woke up early this morning around 4 a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's okay There's nothing left to say, but
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
But don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
And take your cap and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah
And you're gonna think of me, mmm yeah"

redneck woman,gretchen wilson,2004," Well, I ain't never been the Barbie doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky tonk or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip 'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say, 'hey ya'll' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
hell yeah Victoria's Secret, well their stuff's real nice
But I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag
to make my man want me
Well, you might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah'

Guess who's back?
Back again.
Shady's back,

Come here little kiddies, on my lap.
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah,
No worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor,
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay

Touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk

Well I'm sorry,
I don't remember
All I know is this much,
I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body""
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit

i go back,kenny chesney,2004," Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song An' I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levy
Livin' life with no sense of time
An' I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks Every time I hear that song
I go back, I go back I used to rock all night long to, ""Keep On Rockin' Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song An' I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks Every time I hear that song
I go back, I go back We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks Every time I hear that song
I go back, I go back To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back) To watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
I go back
(I go back) To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back
(I go back) I go back, I go back"
we belong together,mariah carey,2005," I didn't mean it when I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you
Guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here,'cause baby When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place

We belong together I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep(too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And its' breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together
But I'm falling apart I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life baby When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up

boulevard of broken dreams,green day,2005," I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a- My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge, and where I walk alone Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a- My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a- I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a- My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby

At my last show I threw away my NWA gold and
Had the whole crowd yellin ""Free Yayo""
So Niggas betta get up outta mine
Fo' I creep and turn yo' projects into columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened to DC
This nigga ain't Gotti
He pretend
He mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems yo' little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south

The cold world that we in
Its full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change its stayin the same How many of them balls was wit ya
When you had that little TV
You had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin with the snub
Cos niggas do a lot of slip talkin in the club
Til they coughing on the rug
I aint never had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model was gone
Snortin up his drugs
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boi' just got poked in the throat
Now its a R.I.P. shirt in my coat
Now im speedin' reminiscin'
Holdin' my weed he never listen
If I see him never livin
Maybe that'll even the score
But if not it'll be me on the floor. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me I started out at 15
Scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack
And i made them sales
As a youth man i used to hustle for loot
With that little deuce deuce
And my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy jesus
Rockin' the leases
But mama whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life an think thank god im blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest You know im still nice wit my cook game
Look man
It's a hood thang
Thats why im loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine
Just like a real nigga should
If I do some time
Homie I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout
Born to die
I took the bullets outta fifty
Put em in my .45
And i aint even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who aint seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop
Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop
Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP

Check check 
this happened for real
Baby Bash, yo
Frankie J
Obession Its early in the morning
And my heart is really lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I dont know how to take it
But its driving me so crazy
I dont know if its right
I'm tossin turning in my bed
Its 5 oclock in the morning
And I still cant sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I dont know what to do but I think I'm in love
Baby... Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart? Now I know you're not my lady I'm just tryin to make this right
I dont know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if u let me could I getchu to say maybe we could ride together
We could do this all nite now I dont care if u got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cuz I kno he cant love u right, quite like I can
Its 5 oclock in the morning
And I still cant sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I dont kno what to do but I think I'm in love Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart? I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
Its an obsession Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin less supreme
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got alot of money, I love to spend it
And thats whats up and I dont care what people scream
You're my blessin when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cuz my money know how I do, we go rendez-vous, mi corazon belongs to you Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong) what am I do wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
What am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong?) what am I do so wrong? 
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor...

listen to your heart,dht featuring edmee,2005," I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah They're swept away and nothing is what is seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye
And there are voices
That want to be heard So much to mention
But you can't find the words
The scent of magic
The beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

Or one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me

And this seems real to me And you love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing?
And I know what I'm going through In my head there's only you now
And this world falls on me
And in this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me And you love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Just let me go
Let me go And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside I know
I know
But all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am

holiday,green day,2005," Say hey! Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame
The shame, the ones who died without a name Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery""
And bleed, the company lost the war today I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line
To find the money's on the other side Can I get another amen?
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday Three, four
The representative from California has the floor ""Sieg Heil"" to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government ""Bang, bang"" goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me Just 'cause
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives This is our lives on holiday"

photograph,nickelback,2005," Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head? And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard to sneakin' out And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal records says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh God, I, I Every memory of lookin' at the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walkin' at the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made The cops hated us hangin' out
They said somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh God, I, I
Every memory of lookin' at the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor It's hard to say it, time to say it Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I, I miss that town
I miss their faces You can't erase
You can't replace it I miss it now I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relieve those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of lookin' at the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door

Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared
I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it

Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growing up
As daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when was teenagers
But then of course
Everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something
We have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
And this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up
And stuck them under the tree
And said some of them were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was saving money
For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
So you can go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
'Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguing a lot
So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat
One bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
But daddy had to work
You and mama had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it
And you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone
Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown
It's almost like your sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are
And daddy's still here
Laney I'm talking to you too
Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise
Mama's gonna be alright
And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdy's neck
I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat
Don't fuck with dad, haha"
la tortura,shakira featuring alejandro sanz,2005," Ay, payita mía, guárdate la poesía
Guárdate la alegría pa' ti No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Y tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos y hablando de ella Ay, amor, me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso, y nos decimos adiós No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas Ay, amor, me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay, amor, es una tortura perderte Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso, y nos decimos adiós No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye, negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mí, que es mejor Oye, mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera sin ti, no tengo paz
Yo sólo soy un hombre arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte
Y me duele tanto que sea así
Sigue llorando perdón
Yo, yo no voy a llorar por ti"

My life just hasn't been the same ohh baby, nooo
When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go
I just broke down (down) Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice
Cuz the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
Its nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything Thats right baby I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby Break it down now I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you its been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you I'll put it down be the woman for you I'm falling so deep for you crazy over for you
I'm calling, calling out to you what am I going to do?
It's true, no fronting
Its you and no other i can no longer go on without you

I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven When we touch
When we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
(And I wanna be inside in your heaven)
I wanna be inside
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven

Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you

I wanna be inside your heaven"
because of you,kelly clarkson,2005," I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you I am afraid I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you"
truth is,fantasia,2005," Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past Talked for awhile, asked him how he's been
Said that he was seeing somebody else
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself (Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you (Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is)
When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad Then he said goodbye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself (Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you (Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is)
When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you Now the truth is, it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
Because I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messing
With my mind, because I know (Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
I guess I'm, I guess I'm (Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
But it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is)
But when it's all said and done
(Guess I'm still in love with you)
Guess I'm still in love with you (Truth is)
Over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you (Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
It's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is)
But when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you I just gotta be honest
I guess, I, I guess I'm still in love, in love"

dont lie,the black eyed peas,2005," Yeah, uh huh
La da da da da da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry! Hey, baby my nose is getting big?
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably cuz my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fuckin' with your heart like I was the Predator
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
Cuz what you did to me I did to you No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Cuz no, no, no, no, yeah
You know, know, know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out?

No, no, no, no don't lie
'Cause you know, you know, you know
You know, you know you gotta try
(Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lying!) She said, I'm leaving...
Cuz she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Trying to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, she know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things
Ooooo ohhh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie...
And now our emotions are drained
Cuz I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained... No, no, no, no baby, no, no
No, no don't lie (No, don't you lie)
Cuz no, no, no, no, yeah

What you gonna do when it all comes out?

daughters,john mayer,2005," I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
She's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me Fathers be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters too... Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left cleaning up the mess he made So fathers be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters too Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong and boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from a woman's good, good heart... On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world So fathers be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too"
as good as i once was,toby keith,2005," She said I seen you in here before
I said I been here a time or two
She said Hello my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face... I said girls... I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
If you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots, got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big fat biker man
I heard David yell across the room
Hey buddy, how 'bout a helpin' hand... I said Dave... I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
If you want to fight tonight
Guess them boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says you can't do this boy
But my pride says oh yes you can... I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin' bullet proof
So don't double-dog dare me now
'Cause I might have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was"

ordinary people,john legend,2005," Girl I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
This time we'll take it slow This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
This time we'll take it slow Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know baby you and I We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy)
We're just ordinary people

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to

I don't gotta promote it for you to know that-
Doc is off the benches.
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges.
We ain't showin' off,
We just goin' off on popular consensus.
But critics say, Doc is soft, Doc is talk,

Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap.
May be raised to be racist,
Who may have never got to see our faces,

Broke down barriers of languages and races.
Just call on the Cape Crusaders,
and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and
we can play the-
Back and forth all day,
Like the hot potato game, that's why we all
came to-
Came here to set this party off right,

One last time I need y'all to roar.
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the
undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can
take.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there,
Become so tired, so much more aware,
I'm becoming this, all I want to do,
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb.
Can I get an encore?
Do you want more?
Bounce now, hands up you know how we do.
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret everybody know.
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money
involved
And plenty honey's involved,
The sunny Sundays and palm trees Cali,
Everyday's just another party from the valleys,
All the way to them
8-mile alley lets rally(8 mile alley lets rally)
Hands up for the grand finale,
Now raise up out your seat,

mississippi girl,faith hill,2005," Yeah Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been 'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Riding my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl Woo! Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams 'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Riding my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl Woo! 'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways

number one spot,ludacris,2005," [Ludacris]
Back again (that's right) Luda! Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time baby
Feelin real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face!
(Yeah)
I'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look [Verse 1]
I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY
Hope all is well, kiss the plantiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of my Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded rapping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me! [Chorus]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm coming for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm coming for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it going it won't stop! (What you doing man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! [Verse 2]
Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell them holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later until these women can't stand
straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars [Chorus]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm coming for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm coming for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it going it won't stop! (What you doin man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! [Verse 3]
Causing lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground running like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sit down and take over the whole world! [Chorus]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm coming for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)

Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change

Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit

Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club

bad day,daniel powter,2006," Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just ahead of the law
You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime And I don't need no carryin' on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day You had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind You had a bad day (Oh. Holiday.)
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong And I'm not wrong So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day"

what hurts the most,rascal flatts,2006,
how to save a life,the fray,2006," Step one, you say, ""We need to talk.""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk.""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

unfaithful,rihanna,2006," Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head, get it over with I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Whoa, oh oh
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...

You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher
I don't care what none of ya'll say I still love her Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

She walkin' around lookin' like Micheal with ya money

Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look at his eyes

And its all for the (money)
Cause envy breeds jealousy, jealousy breeds hate
They on the taste for the (money) My biggest gift and my curse
More money, more problems tell me what's worse Getting audited by the government, giving up millions to the IRS
Or having to take a paternity test from a bitch I never met
I'm getting sued by my own family member, all cause my dog bit her
And she was the one who walked up and put her hand out, and now she got her handout It's driving me crazy, almost as if this shit was planned out
What else can anybody do to me? It ain't new to me when every time I turn around
Another money hungry motherfucker suing me
Truthfully, I've had it up to here
And it don't help that Forbes reports what I'm makin every year They listen closely, and I was really demonized
That I was told to go to school, graduate and get a job
But I'm a Hip Hop cash king, rapper from the South

Say they making millions, and bills steady pillin'
Diamonds on their neck, they kids' stomach out here growlin Get your priorities in order nigga
You talk about it, but you really can't afford it nigga
That car you bought depreciated once you drove off
No wonder your baby momma wanna knock your nose off (BLAHHH)
Half the industry going bankrupt You see em' smiling in the club with their drinks up
Don't let that television fool ya
Off camera they sweating and stressin
My young students, let me school ya The diamonds ain't worth half what you bought them for (no)

Imagine being worth a 100 mill
Your potentials of having a billion is only real
Images, more bitches and they named in your will
A new Mercedes, a baby, your aim was to chill
You choose a pussy or pop a bottle, grow half a mill
All you wanted was some entertainment
All she wanted was some litigation
Exploiting a simple penetration
Telling the courtroom that I'm being evasive
She wanted to walk into the SunTrust
She made me sign over my lil son's trust
Take away the joy my lil daughter brings
Bitch even wanted to take my daughter's rings
Misfortunes of a rich nigga

photograph,nickelback,2006," Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head? And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard to sneakin' out And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal records says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh God, I, I Every memory of lookin' at the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walkin' at the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made The cops hated us hangin' out
They said somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh God, I, I
Every memory of lookin' at the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor It's hard to say it, time to say it Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I, I miss that town
I miss their faces You can't erase
You can't replace it I miss it now I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relieve those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of lookin' at the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door

because of you,kelly clarkson,2006," I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you I am afraid I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty

In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

But you can have what's left of me

Barely breathing
Give me something
To believe in
Tell me: It's not all in my head
Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again
'Cause I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin

Like a burning
To find a place I've never been

Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

Would that make you want to change your scene And wanna be the one on my team (tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point of waiting anymore?
Cause girl I've never been more sure (that baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for (just say ""I do"") Yeah, because

I don't know why she hesitates for man
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
But, still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
If you got a man, try to lose him if you can
Cause the girls worldwide throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
(Trust me) You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'cause you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
Baby friends so fly I can go fly
Private, cause I handle my B.I.
They call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high?
Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
Ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart, St. Bulla anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me

Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

I think I'm losing control Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
'em hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get nate dogg here to sing some shit (Nate dogg)
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

one wish,ray j,2006," Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you... As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause
I'll be okay if I get one If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause
I'll be okay if I get one If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away

who says you cant go home,bon jovi featuring jennifer nettles,2006," I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home
I been there, done thatand I ain't looking that
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
Who says you can't go home"

It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was sooo scared
She threw her hands up in the air Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this all on my own
Imma let it go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on Jesus take the wheel It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way I've been living my life
I know I've got to change So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own Imma let it go
So give me one more chance

waiting on the world to change,john mayer,2006," ""One, two, one two three"" Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing, and
There's no way we ever could Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to be persistent
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would've never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want That's why we're waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (waiting)

when im gone,eminem,2006," Yeah...
It's my life...
In my own words, I guess... Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression
No, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
What happens when you become the main source of pain ""Daddy look what I made""
Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's mommy?""
""I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady
Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh... And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' mommy cry""
""Why? Why is mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more""
""Daddy you're lyin'""
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time""
""But you ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy, no, stop it""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got her picture
""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door it turns to a stage
They're gone, and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seats
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud I'll take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'""
""You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad""
""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'""
""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin""
""I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'""
But baby, wait!
""It's too late, dad, you made the choice""
""Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us""
""That's what they want, they want you Marshall they keep""
""Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep""
""Just take another pill, yeah, I bet that you will""
""You rap about it""
""Yeah, word, k-k-keep it real""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clocks ringin'
There's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to... say And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain
Just smile back"

when youre mad,neyo,2006," It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (cussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you madder (uh, oh)
I'm sorry but seeing you mad is so sexy Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I'm not sure, but one thing that I do know is Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

do i make you proud,taylor hicks,2006," I've never been

That was not me
And now that's who I am Because of you
I am standing tall My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is, do I make you proud? Stronger than I've ever been now
Never be afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud? I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to walk
The road that I believe This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is, do I make you proud? Stronger than I've ever been now
Never be afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud? Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is, do I make you, do I make you proud? This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is, do I make you proud?

before he cheats,carrie underwood,2007," Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying
Her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey Right now, he's probably up behind her
With a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky Right now, he's probably
Dabbing on three dollars
Worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me!
No, not on me 'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

Times Square can't shine as bright as you

Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say you
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to

makes me wonder,maroon 5,2007," I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid I want to dive into you
What you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
it even makes a difference to try
Yeah And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Although)
So this is goodbye I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning Cause I, still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
Yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry

But together we'd be the perfect soulmates

'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are?

(Four, tres, two, uno)
Listen up y'all, cause this is it
The beat that I'm banging is delicious [Verse 1: Fergie]
Fergalicious definition make the boys go loco
They want my treasures so they get their pleasures from my photo
You can see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go, like seasons [Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
Fergalicious (so delicious)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (muah!)
That puts them boys on rock, rock

And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes When you cheated girl
My heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right
But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy You'll see

She's the only one I got
(Ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da) It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend And I know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name
(Ba ba da da) I love it when she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
(Ba ba da da) It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat
And throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure, like Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
(Ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot
(Ba ba da da, ba ba da da) She's got a smile that? ll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue, I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there, man I swear
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song but movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours, not sayin' one word
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love or whatever you call it
But everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like
Take a look at my girlfriend

how to save a life,the fray,2007," Step one, you say, ""We need to talk.""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk.""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

And where your love has always been enough for me

But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, well I'm going home The miles are getting longer, it seems, the closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true and I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try So I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it all

But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you) This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (say ""I do"") Yeah, because

Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady

But, still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
If you got a man, try to lose him if you can
Cause the girls worldwide throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
(Trust me) You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'cause you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
Baby friends so fly I can go fly
Private, cause I handle my B.I.
They call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie

In the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms
Collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind
Get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from
Getting you into the mood
Whoa! One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
""He tastes like you only sweeter""
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories

what ive done,linkin park,2007," In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done For what I've done I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na) What I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na) Forgiving what I've done

Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oooooo
Why did you have to go?
You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone
Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oooooo
And all my tears they
Keep running down my face
Why did you turn away?
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie
What you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me)
You gotta be feeling crazy (crazy)
Oooooo
How can you walk away
Everything stays the same I just can't do it baby
What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that
Oooooo
Why can't you look at me
You're still in love with me Don't leave me crying.
Baby why can't we just
Just start over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance
I can love you right But you're telling me it won't be enough
So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

And the way I feel,
I wanna curl up like a child. I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am If I told you once, I told you twice,
You can see it in my eyes.
I'm all cried out,
With nothing to say.
You're everything I wanted to be.
If you could only see,
Your heart belongs to me.
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free,
Forever yours I'll be,

And break me like that.

Let me be, just don't leave me.

To rise above and beat it So we keep on waiting (waiting)

I see what's goin' down
Cover up with make up in the mirror
Tell yourself it's never gonna happen again
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect Every action in this world will bear a consequence
If you wade around forever you will surely drown
I see what's going down
I see the way you go and say you're right again
Say you're right again, heed my lecture
Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Face down in the dirt she said: This doesn't hurt
She said: I finally had enough
Face down in the dirt she said: This doesn't hurt
She said: I finally had enough One day she will tell you that she has had enough
It's coming round again
Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground? Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Face down in the dirt she says: This doesn't hurt
She says: I finally had enough"

it ends tonight,the allamerican rejects,2007," Your subtleties
They strangle me, I can't explain myself at all
And all the wants
And all the needs all I don't want to need at all
The walls start breathing, my minds unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone A weight is lifted
On this evening
I give the final blow When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight A falling star
Least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain Your finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain
The walls start breathing
My minds unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone A weight is lifted
On this evening
I give the final blow When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight Just a little insight
Won't make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
Now I'm on my own side
It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when your blind It's better that I see it through your eyes
All these thoughts locked inside Now you're the first to know
When darkness turns to light It ends tonight
It ends tonight Just a little insight
Won't make this right
It's too late to fight It ends tonight
It ends when darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
Just a little insight
Won't make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight

Tonight, tonight
Darkness turns to light

I tried hard... but I guess I
gotta try harder. I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin crazyyyy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later. I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me

but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough It's like I'm takin five steps forward, and ten steps back
Tryin' get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh,
I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and
Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain
I keep inflinctin on my family (family)
Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'
And losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man
And I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin not to panic I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough I see thangs won't change
I'm stuck in the game
as soon as I get out it
keeps pullin me back mayne
got me doin' dirty dirt
so used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no 9 to 5 work
studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean
hustlers ballin in force I'm tryin' make that major league
so we never leave never, til' the sun came up
gotta get it nope no leavin no rush
today games they play gotta go hard to get what u put in
if you fall off then it's all on you
gotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool i try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery

welcome to the black parade,my chemical romance,2007," When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"" He said, ""Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?""
""Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join The Black Parade"" When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"" Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches On and on we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on)
Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry)

Wherever you go

Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time Wherever you go
But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now Just take your time
Wherever you go

Yeah huh, that's right If someone said three years from now, you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever and ever
Who knew? Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything When someone said count your blessings now, before they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how, I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever and ever
Who knew?
I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?
If someone said three years from now, you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong and That last kiss I'll cherish until we meet again

'Cos I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all OK Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks
To see my face everywhere

Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew, exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
She may believe you but I never will
Never again If she really knows the truth
She deserves you

Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes
And he's through with you
And he'll be through with you
You'll die together but alone You wrote me in a letter
You couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks
To see my face everywhere
It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew, exactly what you would do

Can get in the way of what I feel for you
When the rain is pouring down And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together through the days and nights I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So 'til the end of time I'm telling you there is no one
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

the great escape,boys like girls,2007," Paper bags and plastic hearts
All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye, but we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
We'll cry, but we won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
But we'll feel so alive Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight All of the wasted time, the
Hours that we've left behind, the
Answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing, tonight Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight!"

walk away remember me,paula deanda featuring the dey,2007," I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me Yeah, I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
And scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids?
Does she know you like to play PS2
Till six in the morning like I do
I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on (uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Walk away
(Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away Walk away
I can't forget how we used to be
Our life from day to day
Hopin' maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
But I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play?
Show up on my doorstep
With a bouquet
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say, baby, I love you
Like you used to?
I can't explain this feeling (I can't explain, yeah) I think about it everyday (everyday)
And even though we've moved on (moved on, uh huh) It gets so hard to walk away
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Walk away

Walk away

You're gonna remember me
Walk away, yeah
I can't forget how we used to be
Yeah, you gon' remember me, boo
I'm gonna remember you too
I can't forget all the crazy shit we used to do
You was doin' too much
I wasn't doin' enough That's what your friends'd say
You got a man anyway
I can't explain it neither
I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see you
When I see you I remember the day
You put your shoes on, and moved on before I could say...
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me, my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose the love that was meant to be? Sometimes I kiss her, wish that it was you that I'm kissin'
Sometimes I miss him, wish that it was you that I'm missin'
Sometimes I hug her, wish that it was you that I'm huggin'
And I realized how much I'm buggin' I miss you
So how do I express this feeling? 'Cause nobody compares to you And you know that she'll never love you like I do (Yeah) I can't explain this feeling (uh huh)
I think about it everyday (everyday, yeah)
And even though we've moved on (yeah)
It gets so hard to walk away
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me Walk away (walk away)
Walk away (walk away)
Walk away
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Walk away
I can't forget how we used to be
(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Forever you will live in my memory
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)
I can't explain this feeling
I think about it everyday (everyday)
And even though we've moved on (moved on)
It gets so hard to walk away
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Walk away (walk away)

first time,lifehouse,2007," We're both looking for something
We've been afraid to find

I'm scared to death

Letting you inside We're feelin' alive all over again
As deep as the sky under my skin
Like bein' in love, she says
For the first time Maybe I'm wrong
I'm feelin' right
When I'm alone
With you tonight
Like bein' in love with you
For the first time The world that I see inside you
Waitin' to come to life
Waking me up to dreamin'
Reality in her eyes Looking at you
Holdin' my breath
For once in my life
I'm scared to death
I'm takin' a chance
Letting you inside We're feelin' alive all over again
As deep as the sky under my skin
Like bein' in love, she says
For the first time Maybe I'm wrong
I'm feelin' right
When I'm alone
With you tonight
Like bein' in love with you
For the first time We're crashing
Into the unknown
We're lost in this
But it feels like home Feelin' alive all over again
As deep as the sky that's under my skin
Like bein' in love, she says
For the first time Well maybe I'm wrong
I'm feelin' right
When I'm alone
With you tonight
Like being'in love with you
For the first time
Like bein' in love, she says
For the first time
Like bein' in love with you
For the first time."

teardrops on my guitar,taylor swift,2007," Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

And there's nowhere to go In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through a field where
all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out Step from the road to the sea to the sky

More money, more problems tell me what's worse Getting audited by the government, giving up millions to the IRS
Or having to take a paternity test from a bitch I never met
I'm getting sued by my own family member, all cause my dog bit her
And she was the one who walked up and put her hand out, and now she got her handout It's driving me crazy, almost as if this shit was planned out
What else can anybody do to me? It ain't new to me when every time I turn around
Another money hungry motherfucker suing me
Truthfully, I've had it up to here
And it don't help that Forbes reports what I'm makin every year They listen closely, and I was really demonized

A new Mercedes, a baby, your aim was to chill
You choose a pussy or pop a bottle, grow half a mill
All you wanted was some entertainment
All she wanted was some litigation
Exploiting a simple penetration
Telling the courtroom that I'm being evasive
She wanted to walk into the SunTrust
She made me sign over my lil son's trust
Take away the joy my lil daughter brings

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes And I think you should know this

bleeding love,leona lewis,2008," Oooh oooh heeey.
Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass Before you know it you're frozen
Oooh.
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true And everyone's looking around
Thinking I'm going crazy
Oooh heeey.
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Oooh...
Trying hard not to hear But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling
Heeey... eey.
But nothing's greater than the rush
That comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love (love) You cut me open, hmm
And it's draining all of me
Oh, they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see
I don't care what they say I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vain
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I...
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love (love)
You cut me open and I...
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love."

But how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air? Can't live, Can't breathe with no air

No air, air No air, air
No air, air
No air, air I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground To float to you
With no gravity to hold me down for real But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived

you can love me Because I say
I won't write you a love song

viva la vida,coldplay,2008," I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"" One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"

The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it

Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter

I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it Ain't no big deal, it's innocent I kissed a girl and I liked it

Well, I am imagining a dark lit place

I wanna make you move because you're standin' still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm lookin' too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home, if one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Put your place, on my place Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you

live your life,ti featuring rihanna,2008," (Rihanna):
You're gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.

Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
(T.I.):
Nevermind what haters say, ignore them 'til they fade away.
Amazing they ungrateful after all the games I gave away.
Safe to say I payed the way, for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violated in a major way.I never been a hater still
I love them, yeah I graze the way.
Some say they so yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor day.
It aint that they black or white, their hands of area in shades of grey.
I'm West side anyway, even if I left the day it fades away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid.
I'll go back to the hood and all you ever did was hate away.
I pray for patience but they make me want to face away. Like I once made them scream, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.
If you ever see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away.

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler
and the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.
Whoever had problems, they reckoncile they just holla 'tip.
If that don't work and just fails, then turn around and follow 'tip.
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.
I do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in. Seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositing
your checks into your bank account, and you're about poverted. Your values is a disarrayed, prioritized are horribly.
Unhappy with the riches cause you piss poor morraly.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.
And we might be full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?

You're gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.

our song,taylor swift,2008," I was ridin' shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart I look around
Turn the radio down
He says
""Baby, is somethin' wrong?
I say
""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says Our song is the slammin' screen door Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on your window When we're on the phone
And you talk real slow 'Cause it's late
And your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home
'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he Could play it again
I was walkin' up
The front porch steps After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
Or been trampled on
And lost
And thrown away Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice All the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone
And you talk real slow
'Cause it's late
And your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home
'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again
I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something
To come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone
And he talks real slow
'Cause it's late
And his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home
before I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again
I was ridin' shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

teardrops on my guitar,taylor swift,2008," Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

I fake a smile so he won't see"

its not my time,3 doors down,2008," Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and love and all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the currents slowly pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this 'Cause it's not my time,
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh, I won't go I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back
All this time I've just been to blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live
Is not what we have, it's what we believe It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know But, it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a wield in me
Now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know Oh, but I won't go
I won't go There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know But, it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a wield in me
Now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see I won't go!
No, I won't go down!

one step at a time,jordin sparks,2008," Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time You believe and you doubt
You're confused, and got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight (when you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time One step at a time
There's no need to rush

let it rock,kevin rudolf featuring lil wayne,2008," I see your dirty face
High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie
Live a lie And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What the saints forgot
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock (2: Kevin Rudolph)
Now the son's disgrased
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine (...)
Just Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

I wish I could be
As cool as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie

the time of my life,david cook,2008," I've been waiting for my dreams
To turn into something
I could believe in
And looking for that
Magic rainbow
On the horizon
I couldn't see it
Until I let go
Gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm coming alive
Body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn And I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time
This is the time to be
More than a name
Or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life Time of my life Holding onto things that vanished
Into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed
Was there all along Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart So I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time
This is the time to be
More than a name
Or a face in the crowd I know this is the time
This is the time of my life
Time of my life And I'm out on the edge of forever Ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground
My arms open wide
My face to the sun I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time
This is the time to be
More than a name
Or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life
My life
More than a name
Or a face in the crowd

Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin' ""No! No! No! N-No!""

I can't keep myself, and still keep you too

You lose, you lose

Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you

love story,taylor swift,2008," We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes & the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""Hello"", little did I know... That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes"" So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes"" Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
...
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said... Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you & that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes"" Oh oh oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

in love with a girl,gavin degraw,2008," So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
who has put in the time
and you know he's gonna be there Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
from the crutch to the cane to the high wire I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) After many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) I'mma tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
Now I know, there's nothing we can't reach Cause a heart can't erase
Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
Who knows me better
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me"

i remember,keyshia cole,2008," Where were you, when I said I loved you
And where were you when I cried at Night
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you, I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out, I remember when I screamed I hated you
But some how deep inside I deep inside still lovin' you Sad and lonely No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love, I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know, where I would go, where I would be
But You made me leave, and plus my heart it just, it just kept telling me so oh I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely I remember when I walked out, I remember when I said I hated you
But some how deep inside still loving you
So sad and lonely There was nowhere else to go oh
No body else to turn to no
For the rest of my life, I promise myself I, will love me first
Then you and me I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely I remember when I walked out, I remember when I said I hated you

The 7 things I hate about you The 7 things I hate about you oh you
You're vain your games you're insecure you love me you like her You make me laugh you make me cry I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say What I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it I'll believe it if you text it I'll delete it let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here The 7 things I hate about you

youre gonna miss this,trace adkins,2008," She was staring out the window, of that, SUV
Complaining saying I can't wait to turn 18
She said I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head, and said I was just like you You're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days, hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this Before she knows it, she's a, brand new bride
In her one bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place, she says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
And daddy shakes his head, and says baby just slow down 'Cause you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days, hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this Five years later there's a plumber, working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing, one kid's crying one kid's screaming
And she keeps apologizing, he says they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own, one's 36, one's 23
Huh, it's hard to believe But you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days, hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this, yeah you're gonna miss this"
love remains the same,gavin rossdale,2008," A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz sounds just like a 'fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
It's all left still to play We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we're over here Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change I, oh I
I wish this could last forever
I, oh I
As if we could last forever Love remains the same
Love remains the same"

You showed me what's right And it feels like tonight

Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight I never felt like this before

love story,taylor swift,2009," We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes & the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""Hello"", little did I know... That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes"" So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes"" Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
...
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said... Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you & that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes"" Oh oh oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Open up your plans and, damn, you're free

And I will nibble your ear A soon da ba ba boom ba baum
Whoa, whoa I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yours So please don't, please don't, please don't

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirt
She's cheer captain

That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see
That I'm the one

Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on
You walk by
They get wrong
You reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion
Way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get your hair that's next
So they don't wanna stop there now they bustin'
Now you gushin' ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times
Bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down now your wheelchair bound
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just
start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say The old me Dead & Gone away.
Ohhhh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone Ohhhh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home) The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone, Dead...
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situations
could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin' smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now think about: ""Damn, what a life I had!""
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight
I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door.
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job
Cost me more
I done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
'Cos I hit you and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who me
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say The old me Dead & Gone away.
Ohhhh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long) Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone
Ohhhh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home) The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone, Dead...
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is Dead & Gone
But that new me will be alright.
'Cause...
Ohhhh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone
Ohhhh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone, Dead..."
you found me,the fray,2009," [Verse 1]
I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything."" [Verse 2]
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad [Chorus:]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me [Verse 3]
In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me [Chorus:]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me [Chorus 3 and outro]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Why'd you have to wait?
To find me, to find me"

knock you down,keri hilson featuring kanye west and neyo,2009," Heh... not again...
Oh... this ain't supposed to happen to me... Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vuitton-ed up or Reebok-in'
You see the hate, that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have - dessert or disaster? I never thought I'd... be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
And you came in... and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race
But I... already won first place I never thought I'd... fall for you as hard as I did
(As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin' about our life, our house and kids (yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down... knocked me down Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down) I've never thought I
Would hear myself say (ooh)
Ya'll go ahead
I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
Of my pimp ship flyin' high (flyin' high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile who shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky) (Hey) 'til now I'm crashing, I don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never to much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down) Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
To seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughin'
We, were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick... hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess have asked someone that's only average
For advice
O.M.G, you listen to that, bitch?
Woe is me
Baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him So I gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So I'll bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh Cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa
I'll admit it, I I was scared to answer loves call
Whoa, whoa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall (When it comes around) Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down) Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love come and knocks you down (oh) Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (yeah)"

live your life,ti featuring rihanna,2009," (Rihanna):
You're gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay ay ay.
intead of chasing that paper.
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters.
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay.
Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
(T.I.):
Nevermind what haters say, ignore them 'til they fade away.
Amazing they ungrateful after all the games I gave away.
Safe to say I payed the way, for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violated in a major way.I never been a hater still
I love them, yeah I graze the way.
Some say they so yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor day.
It aint that they black or white, their hands of area in shades of grey.
I'm West side anyway, even if I left the day it fades away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid.
I'll go back to the hood and all you ever did was hate away.
I pray for patience but they make me want to face away. Like I once made them scream, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.
If you ever see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away.

You're gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.

Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. No telling where it'll take you. Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay.
Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life.
(T.I.):
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler
and the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.
Whoever had problems, they reckoncile they just holla 'tip.
If that don't work and just fails, then turn around and follow 'tip.
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.
I do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in. Seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositing
your checks into your bank account, and you're about poverted. Your values is a disarrayed, prioritized are horribly.
Unhappy with the riches cause you piss poor morraly.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.
And we might be full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?
(Rihanna):
You're gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.

waking up in vegas,katy perry,2009," You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You want to cash out
And get the hell out of town Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
And get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me...
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter, shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby."

Ah-ah, I stayed up again
Oh-oh, I am findin'

Why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober? I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath 'cause what's the use? Ah-ah, the night is callin'
And it whispers to me softly, ""come and play""
Ah-ah, I am fallin'
And if I let myself go, I'm the only one to blame I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinnin' round, spinnin' round, spinnin' round
I'm lookin' for myself
Sober
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinnin' round, spinnin' round, spinnin' round
Lookin' for myself
Sober When it's good, then it's good
It's all good till it goes bad
Till you try to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again!
Broken down in agony
Just tryin' to find a friend

Nothing can touch me
Why do I feel this party's over?

crack a bottle,eminem dr dre and 50 cent,2009," Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes
400 assaults, and 4 murders, the undisputed, most diabolical
Villain in the world, Slim Shady! So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk Ok, let's go
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut
Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio is back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre They see that low rider go by they're like ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
Its what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajauan do what you want Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

if i were a boy,beyonce,2009," If I were a boy
even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed If I were a Boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'll be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home. If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
Cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong But you're just a boy
And you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl someday
You'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed But you're just a boy"

i hate this part,pussycat dolls,2009," We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it, oh
I hate this part right here

gotta be somebody,nickelback,2009," This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere There's gotta be somebody for me out there Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like de ja vu
Me standing here with you So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there You can't give up, (when you're looking for) a diamond in the rough (cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh
Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there"

viva la vida,coldplay,2009," I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"" One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

fireflies,owl city,2009," You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems 'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep) Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep) I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

To wash this memory clean

The distance in your eyes

To fill this hole
Connect this space between

But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing

To wash this memory clean

The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you denied
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide

no surprise,daughtry,2009," And I hope...
And I hope... I've practiced this for hours, gone 'round and 'round
And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why It's no surprise, I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise (And I hope...)
It came out like a river once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever just pushing it down
Felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to say Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise (And I hope...)
If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why It's no surprise, I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
(Stay till today...)
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories
(our memories)
The whispering before we sleep
Just one more thing that you can't keep
(That you can't keep) Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes

There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover and tell you all about it There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out, so it can breathe Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline, in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys, I just want to enjoy
By having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out, so it can breathe SOS, she's in disguise

if today was your last day,nickelback,2009," My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?
What if, what if, if today was your last day? Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had? And would you call oldfriends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day? If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?"

Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry 'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse

21 guns,green day,2009," Do you know what's worth fighting for

Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating? Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother's love Well it's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love Get a little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes

then,brad paisley,2009," I remember, trying not to stare the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later in the front porch light
Taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet, but I thought I loved you then And now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world
And I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There people around but I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again, I thought I loved you then And now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then I can just see you with a baby on the way
I can just see you when your hair is turning grey
What I can't see is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before And now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world
And I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday, at this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say, ""and I thought I loved you then""
And I thought I loved you then"
her diamonds,rob thomas,2009," Oh what the hell she says
I just can't win for losing
And she lays back down Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now By the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be And she says ooh I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down way down
She sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration But it don't feel right
By the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too But don't let her see
And she says ooh, I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground Her diamonds falling down
She shuts out the night
Tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be alright, she'll be alright Just not tonight
And she says ooh, I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground Her diamonds falling
Ooh, I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
But her diamonds bring me down Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor
No more, no more, no more
Diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor
No more, no more, no more
Diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor
(No more, no more)
Her diamonds falling, all her diamonds
Diamonds falling down
I can't take these diamonds falling down"

We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't go to sleep, can't think, can't eat

forever,drake featuring kanye west lil wayne and eminem,2009," It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine Hey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to kill I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from me Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't You are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine Okay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans And I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine"

Habits we ain't kicked We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,

He said ""I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damn if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette He said ""These damn things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

I never talked to him again

He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh but me, I'm doing well And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

One day you won't remember me Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see why I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction, had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free Away from me to see clearly
The way that love can be when you are not with me
I had to leave, I had to live
I had to leave, I had to live If I can't have you let love set you free to fly your pretty wings around

need you now,lady antebellum,2010," Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I can't fight it anymore And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now ---
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now --- (Whoa-whoa)
---
Guess I rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call
But I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind Hey, soul sister

You're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see, I can be myself now finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me Hey, soul sister

Let's take a journey. I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (and then)
Boys break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek (at us) You could travel the world,
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo

But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love

Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah) The girl's a freak
She drives a Jeep
In Laguna Beach I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love LA,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out

airplanes,bob featuring hayley williams,2010,
love the way you lie,eminem featuring rihanna,2010," Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

billionaire,travie mccoy featuring bruno mars,2010," I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of everyday Christmas
Give Travie your wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like 'Here lady have this'
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Ha ha get it? I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, Imma have my own theme music Oh every time I close my eyes
(what you see what you see brah?)
I see my name in shining lights
(uhuh uhuh yeah what else?)
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (so bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (buy everything ha ha)
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (what up Oprah) Oh every time I close my eyes

Oh oooh oh oooh when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad!"
not afraid,eminem,2010," Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now! I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road"

fireflies,owl city,2010," You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems 'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep) Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair

Tryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone

mine,taylor swift,2010," You were in college working part time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts I say, can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parent's mistakes But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine And I remember that fight, 2: 30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now"

I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me -- go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" -- they trying to clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Man""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me

young forever,jayz featuring mr hudson,2010," [Mr. Hudson:]
Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man, [Chorus:]
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever [Jay-Z:]
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some sh-t forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut,
I'll be fine,
I'm forever young... [Chorus] [Jay-Z:]
Fear not when, fear not why,
Fear not much while were alive,
Life is for living not living up tight,
See ya somewhere up in the sky,
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye,
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations while debating up in barber shops,
Young slung, hung here,
Shorty, the n-gga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here,
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears,
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know.
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby, [Chorus] [Jay-Z:]
Slamming Bentley doors,
Hopping out of Porsche's,
Popping up on Forbes lists,
Gorgeous,
Hold up,
N-ggas thought I lost it,
They be talking bullsh-t
I be talking more sh-t
They nauseous,
Hold up,
I""ll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall sh-t,
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit,
Less than four bars,
Guru bring the chorus in,
Did you get the picture yet,
I'm painting you a portrait of young... [Chorus]"

you belong with me,taylor swift,2010," You're on the phone with your girlfriend—she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do. I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirt
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me? Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?"" And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down. You say you're fine—I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that? She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me? Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me Can't you se that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me? Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.

I ain't gon be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of trying
My heart big but it beat quiet I don't never feel like we vibin
Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond Shit is over, whatchu trippin for? I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her Look, My shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow The other chick I'm with never complain
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, She give me deja-vu
And all dat attitude i don't care about it
But all dat shit i do for her you gonna hear about it
Breezy rep two up two down
But i'm jus putting two up chucking up the deuce now
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her"

You have won, you can go ahead tell them, Tell them all I know now

And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me

Ain't no question who we're about to kill I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from me Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't You are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine Okay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans And I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last It may not mean nothing to y'all

Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there

That takes me to another planet

say something,timbaland featuring drake,2010," This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, But I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you we're a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you're really ashamed
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don't match
Is it the money, want me to give it back? This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out

I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?"

And I bet you didn't know under that live oak

This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory

From ""Better Homes and Garden"" magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
And nail by nail and board by board

There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by The sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough time So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar They're worth so much more after I'm a goner

I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe I know, somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

american honey,lady antebellum,2010," She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring
And strong love grows
She grew up good
She grew up slow
Like American honey Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get going
But wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name
Like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days
As the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And an American honey Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything
Can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name
Like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days
As the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey There's a wild wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name
Like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days
As the years go by
Nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind

rolling in the deep,adele,2011," There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands

firework,katy perry,2011," Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin?
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July 'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July 'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough 'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""

how to love,lil wayne,2011," Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love Ooohh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love Ooohh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeahh
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
Yeahh, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that, for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that, for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you

lighters,bad meets evil featuring bruno mars,2011," This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
with my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck, like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward uh
Had a dream, I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up using's no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Popping shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks tryna kid, flipped dick, you did opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell em shove it
Cause it wasn't that, long ago when Marshall sat, flustered lack, lustered
Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up, nothing
Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzin'
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circlin' around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, scuzzes, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain't some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known that from this day forward I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength So let em bic's raise cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8″! This one's for you and me, living out our dreams We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes And now all I wanna see Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did, Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write till he can march right into that post office and tell em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up, must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meooww, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV See me, we fly
Y'all bugging out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag... You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight, we're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shine
Cause, this one's for you and me
living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
with my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters."
if i die young,the band perry,2011," If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song Uh oh uh oh Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colours, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby The sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough time If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song The sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough time And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger, I've never known the lovin' of a man,
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by The sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough time So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin' If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh (uh oh) The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em oh The sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough time So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls"
stereo hearts,gym class heroes featuring adam levine,2011," My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Gym Class Heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that? Like yea, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts If I could only find a note to make you understand

Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops (turn it up)
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo

What if the twins ask why I aint marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Sh-t! But I aint finished growing
Another night the inevitible prolongs
Another day another Dawn
Just tell Taneka and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'

And n-ggas got the nerve to blame you for it And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home Pick up your phone, come on
I'm coming home

Tell the World I'm coming home Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming
""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop We back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you BIG)

I speak the truth but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta, kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer hoe, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
'Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna"

It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe

Caught up in your smile I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight I know that if we give this a little time

dirt road anthem,jason aldean,2011," Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.
Memory lane up in the headlights,
It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires. Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go.
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road.
Jump the barbwire, spread the word.
Light the bonfire, then call the girls.
The king in the can and the Marlboro man.
Jack'n'Jim were a few good men.
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too.
Better watch out for the boys in blue. And all this small town he said, she said,
Ain't it funny how rumors spread.
Like I know something ya'll don't know,
Man that talk is gettin' old.
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth,
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out.
Im tired of talkin, man, ya'll ain't listenin',
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missin'. I'm chillin' on a dirt road.

Memory lane up in the headlights,
It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires. I sit back and think about them good ole days.
The way we were raised, and our southern ways,
And we like cornbread, and biscuits,
And if it's broke round here we fix it.
I can take ya'll where ya need to go,
Down to my hood, back in them woods. We do it different 'round here, that's right,
But we sure do it good, and we do it all night.
See, if you really wanna know how it feels,
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels,
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends,
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends. I'm chillin' on a dirt road.
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.
Memory lane up in the headlights,
It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
I'm turning off of real life, driving that's right,
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.
Thats right. Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road.

i need a doctor,dr dre featuring eminem and skylar grey,2011," I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time I need a doctor, call me a doctor I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life (I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life) It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers' ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'
I'll guarantee they scream, ""Dre, don't leave us like that man!"" 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time

To ever fall back in your arms And I've learned to live half alive

And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul

Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed

back to december,taylor swift,2011," I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why 'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December all the time These days I haven't been sleeping Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time

So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night Do you remember how it used to be
we'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep

I just take my time wit all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at? I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that

take a back road,rodney atkins,2011," Sit in that six lane backed up traffic
Horns are honking, I've about had it
I'm looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here, get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin through the radio static
Changing my mood, a little George Strait 1982 And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country, who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna
Take a back road I've been cooked up, fried down, about forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam,
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wide a twistin
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country, who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes wanna take, makes me wanna
Take a back road Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where park that truck when things get hot
There were park the truck when the things get hot And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country, who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul

somebody that i used to know,gotye featuring kimbra,2012," Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

Watched it pour as I touched your face

Close my eyes, feel you here forever

Stood a girl that looked like you

'Cause you moved to west LA
Or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""how you been""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last Oh but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you

take care,drake featuring rihanna,2012," I know you've been hurt by someone else

I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. we know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do... you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you. instead they say: Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do

The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am I won't give up on us

we are never ever getting back together,taylor swift,2012," I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?) Then you come around again and say, ""Baby
I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you"" We break up, you call me, ""I love you"" Ooh, we called it off again last night, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together Like, ever I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that's much cooler than mine Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never"" Uh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
I'm like, ""I just, I mean this is exhausting
You know, like we are never getting back together""
""Like, ever"" (No!) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together We - getting back together
We - getting back together You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)

the one that got away,katy perry,2012," Summer after high school when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th Birthday
We got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue
Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other We made a pact Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on (whoa) Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the Blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine (No)
Can't replace you with a million rings (No)
I should told you what you meant to me (Whoa)
Cause now i pay the price
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away

Settle down, it'll all be clear Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
Cause I'm going to make this place your home Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons They fill you with fear

ass back home,gym class heroes featuring neon hitch,2012," I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home And you've been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
Cause they be swallowing it I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home No one hold me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We'll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Aww, let's go I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door

Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you want it too
'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it

You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
'Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams

Wanna kiss your lips

springsteen,eric church,2012," To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somwhere between that setting sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
Well, we're just getting started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and sang Oh-h-h-h-h-h
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
Took the long way to your house
I canstill hear the sound of you saying don't go
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night Springsteen. I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I, whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your momma'd think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sounds or the beat of the drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody, sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night Springsteen

We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation I know that much is understood
And I realise
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two And finally I'm forced to face the truth No matter what I say I'm
Not over you
Not over you
Damn, damn girl you do it well
and I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell but still your magnificent

even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

Not over you
And if I had the chance to re-new
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do I could get back, on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

She prayed blow it down
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
(Blown away) She heard the sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind Some people called the take-in shelter
She called a sweet revenge
Shatter every window till it's all blown away

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

You know they're gonna say
We're bad for each other
But we ain't good for anyone else I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over We don't have to miss each other, come over We don't have to fix each other, just come over You don't have to say forever, come over You don't have to stay forever, come over I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over. Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over."
heart attack,trey songz,2012," Turn the lights on! Oh wo-oh, oh wo-oh We share something so common
Still so rare, and I'm in awe
Never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls
Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so... ...In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Turn the lights on! Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (oh wo-oh) would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down
Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way... In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack(oh and it's killing me)
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Turn the lights on! Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (oh wo-oh) would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had And it hurts
'Cause I wanna leave, and you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way...
...In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
If I knew id feel like this man
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
If I knew id feel like this man
Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (oh wo-oh) would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had"

so good,bob,2012,
50 ways to say goodbye,train,2012," My heart is paralyzed
My head was over sized
I'll take the highroad like I should! You said it's meant to be
that it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say: She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntan
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me,
I'm no good at goodbyes! She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me,
I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died... My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours
(a love like yours) She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur? That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say: She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me,
I'm no good at goodbyes! She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me,
I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died... I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to
Love... but you don't want to That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say:

red solo cup,toby keith,2012," Now, red solo cup is the best receptical
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals

And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable

Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin' On them to help me get lucky

And you are the Fruit to my Loom
Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say
Red solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no!) You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend

Thank you for being my friend

its time,imagine dragons,2012," So this is what you meant?
When you said that you were spent?
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell

i dont want this night to end,luke bryan,2012," Girl, I know I don't know you.
But your pretty little eyes so blue,
are pulling me in like the moon on your skin.
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down, get outta town. Got the stars comin' out,
Over my hood.
And all I know now.
Is it's going good. You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck.
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song.
I'm set on cruise control.
I'm slowing loosing hold of everything I got.
You're looking so damn hot.
And I don't know what road we're on,
Or where we've been from starin' at you.
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end. Gonna cuss the morning,
When it comes.
Cause I know that the rising sun,
Ain't no good for me.
Cause you'll have to leave.
Gonna make the most of every mile.
Do anything to make your smile,
Land on my lips.
And get drunk on your kiss.
The clock on the dash,
Says 3: 35.
There's plenty of gas,
And the night's still alive. You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck.
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song.
I'm set on cruise control.
I'm slowing loosing hold of everything I got.
You're looking so damn hot.

Kinda making small talk, killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants

Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man it all looks the same
Miles and miles of backroads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere? They've never drove through Indiana
Met a man who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas They'd understand why God made those fly over states I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul Road and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat On the plains of Oklahoma With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky
You'd think heavens doors have opened You'll understand why God made
Those fly over states
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
Might even want to plant your stakes
In those fly over states
Have you ever been through Indiana

I can hear the ringing on a beat up old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing
Keep on dreaming
even if it breaks your heart Down town is where i used to wonder
Old enough to get there but to young to get inside
So i would stand outside the sidewalk
listen to the music playing every Friday night Oh, I can hear em playing
I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing.
Keep on dreaming
Even if it breaks your heart Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around and bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on getting better
Gotta keep believing if you wanna know for sure Oh, I can hear em playing
I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing

To burn it to the ground You told me yes
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know We're building it up
To break it back down

mirrors,justin timberlake,2013," Aren't you something to admire, 'cause your shine is something like a mirror
And I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you something, an original, 'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled And I can't help but stare 'cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go Just put your hand on the past, I'm here trying to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
when our friends talk about you
all it does is just tear me down
cause my heart breaks a little
when I hear your name It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
caused the good strong woman like you
to walk out my life
now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
and it hunts me every time I close my eyes It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I'm probably too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but I just want you to know I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
when he has the chance
take to every party
cause I remember how much you loved to dance

Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said ""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Would look a hell lot better with you up in it So baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

I'm the nigga, uh caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
God damnit it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I cant even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail

Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
Im getting high
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurts
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with
It, this shit aint work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Dont throw that baby out with the bath water
Youre still alive
Still that nigga

I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home
I was a king, I had a golden throne Those days are gone
Now they're memories on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born Up on a hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak

same love,macklemore and ryan lewis featuring mary lambert,2013," When I was in the 3rd grade
I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Tripping yeah
I guess she had a point, didn't she
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like
""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know
And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written
35 hundreds years ago
I don't know And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm If I was gay
I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man that's gay""
Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color
The complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins
Human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church
They taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service
Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water
That you soak in
Is then poisoned
When everyone else
Is more comfortable
Remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans
That have had their rights stolen I might not be the same But that's not important No freedom til we're equal
Damn right I support it I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm We press play
Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day
That my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful Some would rather die Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start No law's gonna change us We have to change us
Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear Underneath it's all the same love About time that we raised up And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)

sweet nothing,calvin harris featuring florence welch,2013," You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper it's the worst emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know that words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing! Sweet nothing

They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

its time,imagine dragons,2013," So this is what you meant?
When you said that you were spent?
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am It's time to begin, isn't it?

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you made I Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you I don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save their light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"

When I think of letting go
Oh, no

When I think of letting go I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a Croward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box juste the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace

You and I or jealously was not oppressive

Get depressed ought the outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck just kill critics
Buggati never when I'm rich, just God fearind
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr mike caren, tell his Billir Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries

little talks,of monsters and men,2013," I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes Some days I can't even trust myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore (Hey!)
Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey!)
The screams all sound the same
(Hey!)
Though the truth may vary this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore (Hey! Hey!)
You're gone, gone, gone away,
I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart,
There's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me
Please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep (Hey!)
Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey!)
The screams all sound the same
(Hey!)
Though the truth may vary this

Bodies safe to shore Don't listen to a word I say

And coming over
And we would talk all afternoon Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me

Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends
anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

berzerk,eminem,2013," Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em ""stick it""
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, yah, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch!
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch! (Take your shoes off)
(Let your hair down and)
(Go berzerk)
All night long (Grow your beard out)
(Just weird out and)
(Go berzerk)
All night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn your volume loud, cause its gonna mayhem till the AM
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go Berzerk), shake your body Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang - bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang dang
P-p-p pow pow chicka chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel toww
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh huh, how how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho... (Take your shoes off)

So everybody, everybody, get your vials They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep
And woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
Car note!
Oh! Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard! But don't be discouraged girl

catch my breath,kelly clarkson,2013," I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time Catching my breath, Letting it go,
Turning my cheek, For the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right Catch my breath,
No one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,
Won't let them let me down,
It's all so simple now Addicted to the love i found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith when it comes around
I will spent the rest of my life Catching my breath, Letting it go,
Turning my cheek For the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right Catch my breath,
No one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,
Won't let them let me down,

The beauty in everything Catching my breath, Letting it go,

the a team,ed sheeran,2013," White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately,
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us 'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately,
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us 'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time will fade out tonight
Straight down the line And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately,
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland

To fly, fly

carry on,fun,2013," Well, I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the Fourth of July You swore and said we are not, we are not shining stars
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through Hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone, carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground, carry on Carry on, carry on So I met up with some friends in the edge of the night
At a bar off seventy five
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbours and wives But I like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets, I am not the ghost you want of me If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone, carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and, carry on Woah, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine, after all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phone, show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now 'Cause we are, we are shining stars
We are invincible, we are who we are
On our darkest day, when we're miles away
So we'll come, we will find our way home If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone, carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and, carry on No one's ever gonna stop us now
No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop
No one's ever gonna stop us now
No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop
No one's ever gonna stop, no one's ever gonna stop us now"

You will find him, you'll find him next to me You won't find him tryna chase the devil
For money, fame, for power, out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you'll find him next to me Next to me - ooh hooo
Next to me - ooh hooo
Next to me - ooh hooo
You will find him, you'll find him next to me When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me Next to me - ooh hooo
Next to me - ooh hooo
Next to me - ooh hooo
I will find him, I'll find him next to me When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we've spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us

mamas broken heart,miranda lambert,2013," I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next all I know, I couldn't stop Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart But this ain't my mama's broken heart
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart But this ain't my mama's broken heart
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your I's
And never let 'em see you cry
Go and fix your make up, well it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mamma's broken heart"

Yeah girl, you make me wanna write a song And it goes like ooh,
What I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you.
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away,
Yeah it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss,
Yeah it goes like this. Hey girl, you make me wanna drive you home,
Get you outta here and get you all alone.
I don't know what it is about you, baby, but I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy,
But you make me wanna write a song. And it goes like ooh,
What I wouldn't do,
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you.
And it goes like hey,
Girl I'm blown away,

brave,sara bareilles,2013," You can be amazing 
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug 
You can be the outcast 
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love 
Or you can start speaking up 
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do 
And they settle 'neath your skin 
Kept on the inside and no sunlight 
Sometimes a shadow wins 
But I wonder what would happen if you  Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  I just wanna see you

I wanna see you be brave  Everybody's been there, everybody's been stared down 
By the enemy 
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing 
Bow down to the mighty 
Don't run, stop holding your tongue 
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live 
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in 
Show me how big your brave is  Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  Innocence, your history of silence 
Won't do you any good 
Did you think it would? 
Let your words be anything but empty 
Why don't you tell them the truth?  Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out

the monster,eminem featuring rihanna,2014," I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me
For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Hit the lottery, oh wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think 'Cause I'm I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's not fair
Well, that's not fair Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)
Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it My OCD's conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleeptalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's not fair
Well, that's not fair Call me crazy but I have this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
MC's, blood get spilled and I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
Get along with the voices inside of my head

let it go,idina menzel,2014," The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway"

Guided by a beating heart

Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me So wake me up when it's all over

Didn't know I was lost So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize So wake me up when it's all over

Didn't know I was lost So wake me up when it's all over

And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you made I Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you I don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save their light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside

Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage I know that in the morning now

Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between

Praise Jesus, hallelujah I'mma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air, and you lean forward
Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind

Till I'm everywhere that you be at

dont,ed sheeran,2014," La, la, la, la I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing...
la, la, la, la
Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me & her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about
Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how I was confused about
She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe On my hotel door!
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you
Trust & respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun & I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload

sing,ed sheeran,2014," It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now And I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the programme
I want you to be mine, lady
And to hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time, lady I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh Sing!
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Louder!
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Sing!
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""we found love in a local rave"", no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then hope and pray I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh Sing!
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Louder!
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Sing!
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
I found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling?
Before the beat kicks in again Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Sing!
I need you, darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
(Louder!)
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh
(Sing!)
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh

Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend,
Thinkin', ""No way she ain't got one.""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again."" I'd a gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again."" The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile

brave,sara bareilles,2014," You can be amazing 
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug 
You can be the outcast 
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love 
Or you can start speaking up 
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do 
And they settle 'neath your skin 
Kept on the inside and no sunlight 
Sometimes a shadow wins 
But I wonder what would happen if you  Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave  I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave  Everybody's been there, everybody's been stared down 
By the enemy 
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing 
Bow down to the mighty 
Don't run, stop holding your tongue 
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live 
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in 
Show me how big your brave is  Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  Innocence, your history of silence 
Won't do you any good 
Did you think it would? 
Let your words be anything but empty 
Why don't you tell them the truth?  Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave  I just wanna see you

Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about no 'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour Coming down

One love, one house

drunk on a plane,dierks bentley,2014," I took 2 weeks vacation, for the honey moon
A couple tickets all inclusive, down in cancun
I couldn't get my money back so,
I'm in seat 7A
I'm gettin' drunk on a plane I bet the feller on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture
To the seat back right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottle fillin' both our trays
I'm gettin' drunk on a plane Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party.
Got this seven thirty-seven rockin' like the G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention It's mardi gras
Up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why, I'm gettin' drunk on a plane. We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo to the airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom
Alone up there on top of the cake
So hey, I'm gettin' drunk on a plane Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party.
Got this seven thirty-seven rockin' like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention It's mardi gras
Up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down.
I'll try anything to drown out the pain.
They all know why, I'm gettin' drunk on a plane. On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her 'Kiss my ass'
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane Buyin' drinks of everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this seven thirty-seven rockin' like a G6
Stewardess is something sexy
Leanin' pourin' coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention It's mardi gras
Up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down.
I'll try anything to drown out the pain.
They all know why, I'm gettin' drunk on a plane. I'm gettin' drunk on a plane.
I'm might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now, I'm drunk on a plane."

Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye What I'm really needing now Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around 'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off Wanna get a little lost

Bring it 'til his memory fades away Hey bartender Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far I'll let him down easy

Dancing with my girls to the DJ

amnesia,5 seconds of summer,2014," I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you? Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine? 'Cause I'm not fine at all I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape 'Cause I'm not fine at all The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine? 'Cause I'm not fine at all I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream

Can I hit the freeway? I'm illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashing
I'm ducking bucking them out here

Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this

See what's poppin' at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe... some
swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Girl does she want it low?

Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Magic Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how I was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better

thinking out loud,ed sheeran,2015," When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? And, darling, I will be loving you till we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through

But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride So let the light guide your way, yeah

Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week ""We were born sick""
You heard them say it My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life If I'm a pagan of the good times

To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, amen, amen, amen Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life Take me to church

im not the only one,sam smith,2015," You and me, we made a vow
for better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one

Worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout ya'll niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, Jon and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut- hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if they name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck wit', mad bitches we don't fuck wit'
I don't fuck wit' them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning And tell them bitches, blow me, Lance Stephenson Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only Rich niggas only, independent bitches only Boss niggas only, thick bitches only I got my real niggas here by my side, only I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought God damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though

Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it And Nicki if you ever try to fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she act like she need dick in her life
But that's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallow the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, street beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout running in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes wit me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang take the B off behavior, my nigga

the heart wants what it wants,selena gomez,2015," "" I was on stage and I was thinking of...

But I didn't realize that
Feeling so confident, feeling so great about myself...
And then it just be completely shattered by one thing
By something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy baby
Feel like it's my fault
I was in pain..."" You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known I'm hoping
That after this fever, I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odd's against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you'd disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip no more, so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I bet the odd's against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy ending, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments breaking me down
Down, down, down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I bet the odd's against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?

Cop cars with the loose change

Cuddle buddies on the low

I'll put one leg on the tub

Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub and I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, tasting kind of lonely You're gone and I got to stay
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind Spend my days locked in a haze, tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high, all my life to forget I'm missing you Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive
Make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy You're gone and I got to stay
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind Spend my days locked in a haze, tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high, all my life to forget I'm missing you Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain
Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain You're gone and I got to stay

I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars are nothing without you Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming
It's much too strong Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here
If I can't be with you tonight I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?

Salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed... Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'mma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep her safe

A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?"" It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep her safe

So I'm going over time on the overtime
Yeah, I'm not invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together? I Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school

heartbeat song,kelly clarkson,2015," This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long Up up all night long
You, where the hell did you come from
You're a different, different kind of fun
And i'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me Haven't felt it for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If i'd have known where i'd be now Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh I could do this for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long Up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long Up up all night long
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (one more time)
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long (Yeah)
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it

dont,ed sheeran,2015," La, la, la, la I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing...
la, la, la, la
Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me & her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about
Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how I was confused about
She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe On my hotel door!
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you
Trust & respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun & I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"
ghost,ella henderson,2015," I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
Guess I love living in the sin Oh you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learn I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Stop the haunting baby Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
No more haunting baby I keep going to the river I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away

here,alessia cara,2015," I guess for now you've got the last laugh I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
with this boy who's hollerin' and I can hardly hear
over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
But usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message
(Like we usually do) And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?"" Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

waves,mr probz,2015," My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground,
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream"
el perdon,nicky jam and enrique iglesias,2015," Dime si es verdad
Me dijeron que te estás casando
Tú no sabes lo estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir Cuéntame
Tu despedida para mí fue dura
Será que él te llevó a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo así Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me esto está matando, oh no Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta Es que yo sin tí, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta Vivir sin tí, no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en la soledad Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedirte perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me está matando oh no Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh Es que yo sin tí, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta Es que yo sin tí, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta Yo te juré a tí eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío oh oh, oh Yo sé que él te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón Es que yo sin tí, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta, oh no
Esto no me gusta Es que yo sin tí, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta oh yeah, oh (Y tú sin mí) 
Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene hasta que lo pierde pero...
(Y yo sin tí) Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere
(No puedo vivir así) Y hacer el intento
(No quiero vivir así)

Having no regrets is all that you really want
We're only getting older, baby

Everything you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
