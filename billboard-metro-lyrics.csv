Everything's waiting for you. Don't hang around and let your problems surround you

where they never close downtown. Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over happy again.

Didn't you?
People call
Say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you
You used to Laugh about Everybody that was Hangin' out Now you don't
Talk so loud
Now you don't
Seem so proud About having to be scrounging
Your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah, you've Gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna
Have to get
Used to it
You say you never
Compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you
Realize
He's not selling any Alibis
As you stare into the vacuum
Of his eyes
And say
""Do you want to
Make a deal?""
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah, you
Never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't
Let other people
Get your
Kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your
Diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a
Siamese cat
Ain't it hard
When you discover that
He really wasn't
Where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To have on your own
No direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah
Princess on the steeple and all the
Pretty people they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they
Got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better
Take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, babe
You used to be
So amused
At Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used
Go to him now
He calls you
You can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin'
You got
Nothin' to lose
You're invisible now
You got no secrets
To conceal
How does it feel
Ah, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?"

now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
for now i have to tell you everyday
My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
softer than a sigh
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean
wider than the sky
my love is brighter than the brightest star
that shines every night above
and there is nothing in this world
that can ever change my love
my love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
softer than a sigh
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean
wider than the sky
my love is brighter than the brightest star
that shines every night above
and there is nothing in this world
that can ever change my love"

The morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball. You never cared for secrets I'd confide.
For you I'm just an ornament,
Something for your pride. Always running, never caring,
That's the life you live.
Stolen minutes of your time
were all you had to give. And I think it's gonna be all right.

The morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball. The story's in the past with nothing to recall.
I've got my life to live and I
don't need you at all The roller coaster ride we took is
nearly at an end.
I bought my ticket with my tears,
that's all I'm gonna spend. And I think it's gonna be all right.

i am a rock,simon  garfunkel,1966," A winter's day
In a deep and dark December;
I am alone,
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I am a rock,
I am an island. I've built walls,
A fortress deep and mighty,
That none may penetrate.
I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock,
I am an island. Don't talk of love,
But I've heard the words before;
It's sleeping in my memory.
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
If I never loved I never would have cried.
I am a rock,
I am an island. I have my books
And my poetry to protect me;
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.
I touch no one and no one touches me.
I am a rock,
I am an island. And a rock feels no pain;
And an island never cries."

the sound of silence,simon  garfunkel,1966," Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly, creeping
Left its seeds while I was, sleeping
And the vision, that was planted in my brain... still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound, of silence
And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs, that voices never shared
No one dared
Disturb the sound, of silence
""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows""
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed, in the wells, of silence
And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls,
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds, of silence"""
lady godiva,peter and gordon,1966," Seventeen, a beauty queen
She made a ride that caused a scene
In the town Her long blonde hair
Hangin' down around her knees
All the cats who dig striptease
Prayin' for a little breeze
Her long blonde hair
Falling down across her arms
Hiding all the lady's charms
Lady Godiva She found fame and made her name
A hollywood director came into town
And said to her
""How'd you like to be a star?""
""You're a girl that could go far""
""'specially dressed the way you are""
She smiled at him
Gave her pretty head a shake
That was Lady G's mistake
A-hey-hey-hey
Lady Godiva He directs certificate 'X'
And people now are craning their necks
To see her
'cause she's a star
One that everybody knows
Finished with the striptease shows
Now she can't afford her clothes Her long blonde hair
Lyin' on the barber's floor
Doesn't need it long anymore

homeward bound,simon  garfunkel,1966,
did you ever have to make up your mind,the lovin spoonful,1966," Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind? Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide? Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind? Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says ""Better go home, son, and make up your mind""
Then you bet you'd better finally decide!
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?"

almost persuaded,david houston,1966," Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips coal black hair and eyes
That would tempt any man Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside Then we danced and she whispered I need you
Take me away from here and be my man
Then I've looked into her eyes
And I saw it, the reflection of my wedding band And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home"

I was feeling kinda seasick
The crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale She said, ""There is no reason
And the truth is plain to see""
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale"

reflections,the supremes,1967," Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust..."

Is it just for the moment we live What's it all about

Or are we meant to be kind? And if, if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule? As sure as I believe there's a heaven above
Alfie, I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed
You're nothing, Alfie When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day Alfie, oh Alfie
What's it all about Alfie?"

How many times will she fall for his lines
Should I tell her or should I keep cool
And if I tried I know she'd say I lied
Mind your business don't hurt her you fool

penny lane,the beatles,1967," In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Here beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
For a fish and finger pie
In summer meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

white rabbit,jefferson airplane,1967,
bernadette,four tops,1967," Bernadette, people are searchin' for
the kind of love that we possess.
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
and never find the love I've found in you. And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes,
and I'm well aware of what's on their minds.
They pretend to be my friend, when all the time
they long to persuade you from my side.
They'd give the world and all they own
for just one moment we have known. Bernadette, they want you because of the pride that gives,
But Bernadette, I want you because I need you to live.
But while I live only to hold you,
Some other men, they long to control you.
But how can they control you Bernadette,
when they can not control themselves, Bernadette,
from wanting you, needing you,
But darling you belong to me. I'll tell the world, you belong to me,
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me,
I'll tell the world, you're a part of me, Bernadette. In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
the world is searching for,
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
has always been longing for. In you I have what other men long for.
All men need someone to worship and adore,
that's why I treasure you and place you high above,
for the only joy in life is to be loved.
So whatever you do, Bernadette, keep on loving me,
Bernadette, keep on needing me,
Bernadette. Bernadette.
You're the soul of me,
more than a dream, your a plan to me.
And Bernadette, you mean more to me,
than a woman was ever meant to be."
the beat goes on,sonny  cher,1967,
snoopy vs the red baron,the royal guardsmen,1967," The news had come out in the First World War
The bloody Red Baron was flying once more
The Allied command ignored all of its men
And called on Snoopy to do it again. Was the night before Christmas, 40 below
When Snoopy went up in search of his foe
He spied the Red Baron, fiercely they fought
With ice on his wings Snoopy knew he was caught. Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ring out from the land
Asking peace of all the world
And good will to man The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights
He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight
Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know
Or was it the bells from the village below. Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to man The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine
And forced him to land behind the enemy lines
Snoopy was certain that this was the end
When the Baron cried out, ""Merry Christmas, my friend!"" The Baron then offered a holiday toast
And Snoopy, our hero, saluted his host
And then with a roar they were both on their way
Each knowing they'd meet on some other day. Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to man (x3)"

They've got a word ""love"" to sell you
They mean exactly what they say I dig rock and roll music

I think I could say somethin' if you know what I mean
But if I really say it
The radio won't play it

macarthur park,richard harris,1968," Spring was never waiting for us, girl
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers
By the trees MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have the recipe again
Oh, no There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
Oh, after all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again

Kissing on another man

And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there

Silver horses ran down moonbeams, in your dark eyes.
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment. I'll wait in this place, where the sun never shines.
Wait in this place, where the shadows run, from themselves. You said no strings, could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into, such a sad time, at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need, just beginning. I'll wait in the queue, when the trains come back.
Lying with you, where the shadows, run from themselves. At the party, she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound, now forgotten
Yellow tigers, crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.
I'll sleep in this place, with the lonely crowd.
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves."
youre all i need to get by,marvin gaye  tammi terrell,1968," You're all I need to get by.
Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see,
You were my destiny.
With my arms open wide,
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're All I need to get by.
I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, You're all I need to get by. You're all I need to get by.
Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best,
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, You're All I need to get by. I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, You're all I need to get by."

Without no seams nor needlework
(Blankets and bedclothes, the child of the mountains)
Then she'll be a true love of mine (Sleeps unaware of a clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun) Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme

And gather it all in a bunch of heather (And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

And you need not know why
C'mon people now,
Smile on your brother
Ev'rybody get together
Try and love one another right now
Some will come and some will go
We shall surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moments sunlight
Fading in the grass
C'mon people now,
Smile on your brother
Ev'rybody get together
Try and love one another right now
If you hear the song I sing,
You must understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command
C'mon people now,
Smile on your brother
Ev'rybody get together
Try and love one another right now

But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left he went and named me Sue. Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
An' it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through. Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue. Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame. But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that gave me that awful name. Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. In an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue. Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue! How do you do? Now you gonna die!""
Yeah! That's what I told him. Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece o' my ear. I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer. I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile. And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along. So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong.""
Yeah! He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your gut and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue.""
Yeah, what could I do? What COULD I do?
I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my pa and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view.
And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

atlantis,donovan,1969," The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean.
So great an area of land,
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease,
In their ships with painted sails.
To the East Africa was a neighbour,
Across a short strait of sea miles.
The great Egyptian age is But a remnant of The Atlantian culture.
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from far Atlantis. Knowing her fate,
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.
On board were the Twelve: The poet, the physician, The farmer, the scientist,
The magician and the other so-called Gods of our legends.
Though Gods they were -
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice
And let us sing
And dance and ring in the new Hail Atlantis! Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be,
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be.

And their parents don't see them no more You wanna stop and hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go

ruby dont take your love to town,kenny rogers  the first edition,1969," You painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating
Going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall
Tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town It wasn't me
That started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go
And do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that
I'm not the man I used to be Oh, Ruby I still need some company It's hard to love a man
Whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age
Ruby, I realized But It won't be Long,
I've heard them say until I'm not around Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
She's leaving now cause
I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun
And put her in the ground
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby for God's sake turn around"

Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean And they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine Oh we make one another cry
Break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other was to blame Neither one ever will give in
So we gaze at our eight by ten
Thinking 'bout the things that might have been
It's a dirty rotten shame Repeat Chorus People walking up to you
Singing glory hallelulia
And they're tryin to sock it to you
In the name of the Lord They're gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope, cheat your faith
And further more to hell with hate
Come on and get on board Repeat Chorus Look around tell me what you see
What's happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To remember who I am Cause you've given up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turned your back on humanity

Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me You took me from the shelter of my mother
I had never known or loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before Since you've been gone

spill the wine,eric burdon  war,1970," Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
in a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me,
an overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
should be the star of a Hollywood movie But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones... Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said: Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl (spoken:)
I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
so it's all in my head
and then. I heard her say one more time: (sung:)
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl (spoken:)
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said: (sung:)
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

love on a twoway street,the moments,1970," I feel the 4 become 5
And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting 
For you to walk down the boulevard  and
To take me, take me, take me 
But the moment you appear 
You wake me, wake me, wake me
Out of the slumbers of my head 
From the slums of loneliness And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to heist me 
When love is a two way street
(Love is a two way street)
And I think I'm ready 
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me
(Love is a two way street) We're coming close to our fate
They'll put a star beside our names 
But I couldn't care for the history
When I've got you in front of me
The cars could all collide 
The shards of glass  won't catch my eye 
Because you're almost by my side 
We're counting down at the green light And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to heist me 
When love is a two way street
(Love is a two way street) And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me

patches,clarence carter,1970," (Spoken:)
I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside
He was hurt 'cause he'd done all he could My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
He said ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you"" (Spoken:)
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best,
It's up to you to do the rest"" (Spoken:)
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, 'cause Everyday I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows people, I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you"" Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin'
""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
I tried to do my best,
It's up to you to do the rest"". I could still hear papa when he's sayin'
""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you""

Fly away with you The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again
Should I decide to stay

To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you

I'll never see your smilin' face or touch your hand
If just once more I could see
You, our home, and our little baby Indiana wants me

i know im losing you,rare earth,1970," Your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', woman I feel it fade Ah, woman, woman your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooo babe, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's there everywhere
Baby, baby, babe, I'm losing you When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face, I see
I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me It's all over your face
Someone's takin' my place
Ooo baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness you feel inside
Oo babe, I'm losing you I can't bear the thought of losing you
Ah woman, can't you see what I'm goin' through
I'm losin' my mind (losin' my mind)
And it's all because of you
I can't bear the thought of losing you
I'm losin' my mind (losin' my mind)
And it's all because of you
I can't stand the thought of losing you"

my baby loves lovin,white plains,1970," I'm gonna tell this heart of mine
I've gotta find a way to just forget her
Gonna try and say, it's time to let her
Go her own sweet way But every little move she makes
Only takes my love a little closer
Any other guy who really knows her
Would feel the same way too
And every time she looks my way
I have to say I hear the music playing
Voices in my head that keep on saying
She's the one for you Of all the other girls I've known
This one is in a class all on her own
And though I've tried, I've really tried
I just can't leave that girl alone Every little move she makes
Only takes my love a little closer
Any other guy who really knows her
Would feel the same way too Every little move she makes
Only takes my love a little closer
Any other guy who really knows her
Would feel the same way too Of all the other girls I've known
This one is in a class all on her own

arizona,mark lindsay,1970," She must belong to San Francisco
She must have lost her way
Postin' a poster of Poncho and Cisco
One California day
She said she believes in Robin Hood and brotherhood
And colours of green and grey
And all you can do is laugh at her
Doesn't anybody know how to pray? Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world
My myyy
Arizona, cut off your Indian braids
Arizona, hey won'tcha go my way Mmmm strip off your pride you're acting like a teeny-bopper run away child
And scrape off the paint from the face of a little town saint
Arizona, take off your hobo shoes
Arizona, hey won'tcha go my way Follow me up to San Francisco
I will be guide your way
I'll be the Count of Monte Cristo
You'll be the Countess May
And you can believe in Robin Hood and brotherhood and rolling the ball in the hay
And I will be reading you an Aesop's fable
Anything to make you stay-ay-ay Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world, my my

fire and rain,james taylor,1970," Just yesterday mornin' they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again Won't you look down upon me Jesus you've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
I've seen fire and I've seen rain Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby one more time again now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you thought I'd see you fire and rain now
