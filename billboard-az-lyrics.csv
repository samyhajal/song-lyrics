love is,vanessa williams and brian mcknight,1993," They say it's a river, that circles the earth

It conquers all
It changes everything They say it's a blessing
They say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle and I believe that it is
It conquers all
but it's a mystery Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily In this world we've created
In this place that we live
In a blink of an eye, baby, the darkness slips in
Love lights the world, unites the lovers for eternity Love breaks the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And turns it in to the beauty that remains Look at this place
It was paradise but now it's dying
I'll pray for love
I'll take my chances that it's not too late Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily Love breaks the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And turns it in to the beauty that remains"
runaway train,soul asylum,1993," Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like the madman laughing at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same"
ill never get over you getting over me,expose,1993," I hear your taking the town again
Having a good time
With all your good time time friends
I don't think that you think of me
Your on your own now
And i'm alone and free I know that i should get on with my life
But a life live without you could never be right As long as the star shine down from the heaven
As long as the river run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me I tried to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody i was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away
Loneliness found me looks like its here to stay I know that i ought to find someone new
But all i found is my self always thinking of you As long as the star shine down from the heaven
As long as the river run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me Oh no matter what i do
Each nights a life time to live through
I can't go on like this
I need your touch
Your the only one i ever loved
And as long as the star shine down from the heaven
As long as the river run to the sea
I'll never get over you, getting over
I'll never get over you
I'll never get over you getting over me..."

Paid in full, so now you know
why my belly's round

just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto,
but yo, takin' me to another level
Let the beat ride,
but hold on to your women, G

so many women wanna do me
It make a man say ""damn""
I'm finally taxin'
more than your homey Sam
But let me speak with the weak,
I mean the rookies
My time is held up,
extremely for cookies
Just let me clock
this groove in ninety two
Hey, you don't bother me
and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And ah, you just watch
a brother flowin' like Niagra
Think before you step,
because these niggas
just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold d's on my four and gold lex,
cuz I got it made
I broke the veto once again
because I had to
And just like Jody Watley,
baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track,
and yo, any way is ok
Your place or mine,
all night until the next day
Uh Chorus:
Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see
if I want you
Just do the ditty-ditty
if you want to
Because then I can see
if I want you Now here we go from the top
Second verse of the same song
With the conclusion,
all should be happy for the ding-dong
It's just a mad park a grip, G
It's like, every brother that i
see be like, ""Do you remember me?""
A hustler, and it's on
with more hoes to lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego,
so they can play with my eggo
I have a tendancy to flow,
start off with my own groove and
Pick up the mic, and all of a sudden,
I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic,
and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum
I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo,
believe I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me
with the chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note,
just to show up token
Tote on his ass
when I scoop him,
cuz we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it
and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe,
I'll take you there
Huh (Chorus) Now here we go
Uh, let's take a trip to another land
Park a grip, come back
and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the lex-o,
and roll out to my cabin
Believe me, my brother,
more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling,
just because the gold rings
But I'm like a so but yo,
you ain't heard a damn thing
Make sure you got the jim hats,
strapped for protection
Because to me,
my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand,
if you a fan, it ain't over yet
Cuz doin' the ditty with Paperboy
makes the ocean sweat
Leave you kinda startled
like the funk off of fritos
Make you man jealous,
while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault,
I lay the piper with concern
And I ain't from Mount Vernon,
but a brother's money-earnin'
And for those disagree,
and then jack, that's a pitty
Just bob your head
for Paperboy and the ditty
Yeah (Chorus)"

the river of dreams,billy joel,1993," In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
From the mountains of faith
(Mountains of faith)
To the river so deep
(River so deep)
I must be looking for something
(Looking for something)
Something sacred I lost
(Sacred I lost)
But the river is wide
(Oh is wide)
And it's too hard to cross
(Too hard to cross) Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find what I've been looking for In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
Through the valley of fear
(Valley of fear)
To a river so deep
(River so deep)
I've been searching for something
(Searching for something)
Taken out of my soul
(Taken out of my soul)
Something I'd never lose
(Never lose)
Something somebody stole
(Something somebody stole) I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
Hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is I've been looking for In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
Through the jungle of doubt
(Jungle of doubt)
To the river so deep
(River so deep)
I know I'm searching for something
(Searching for something)
Something so undefined
(So undefined)
That it can only be seen
(Only be seen)
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night Not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by fire, I wade into the river
That is runnin' through the promised land In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
Through the desert of the truth
(Desert of truth)
To the river so deep
(River so deep)
We all end in the ocean
(End in the ocean)
We all start in the streams
(Start in the streams)
We're all carried along
(Carried along)
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night"

Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Must a imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I Have Nothing
Nothing
Nothing, if I don't have you (you-oo, you-oo, you) You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love (mm.)
uhh, I never knew
Love like I've know it with you
Will our memories survive?
One I can hold on to A don't really need to look

mr wendal,arrested development,1993," Here, have a dollar,
in fact, no brother-man here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me,
but it means a big deal to you
""Be strong, serve God only,
know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits""
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name,
no one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum,
until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges,
still most of y'all come out confused [CHORUS:]
Go ahead, Mr.Wendal (2x) Mr.Wendal has freedom,
a free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
for Mr.Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
and an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him,
but I just saw him
eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no?
Who are we to judge?
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
and killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
but we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far,
and we got too far, cause on him we walk Mr.Wendal, a man, a human in flesh,
but not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride,
realize that all in all you stand tall [CHORUS] Mr.Wendal, Lord, Mr.Wendal"
have i told you lately,rod stewart,1993," Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do For the morning sun and all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort, too
You fill my heart with laughter
Somehow, you make it better Ease my troubles, that's what you do There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you

Take away all my sadness

ordinary world,duran duran,1993," Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well, now, pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But, I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
(Just blown away...)
Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world
Every world is my world"
