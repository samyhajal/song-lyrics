abracadabra,steve miller band,1982,
hard to say im sorry,chicago,1982,
tainted love,soft cell,1982," Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears, and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh oh) Tainted love Now I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away, you don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you Take my tears, and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh oh)
Tainted love Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love
Tainted love"

harden my heart,quarterflash,1982," Cryin' on the corner, waitin' in the rain
I swear I'll never, ever wait again
You gave me a word, but words for you are lies
Darlin', in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
All of my life, I've been waitin' in the rain
I've been waitin' for a feeling that never, ever came
It feels so close but always disappears
Darlin', in your wildest dreams, you never had a clue
But it's time you got the news
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
Darlin', in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
I'm a-gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm a-gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
Harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
No, oh, oh, oh
Harden my heart
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm a-gonna harden my heart"

i cant go for that no can do,daryl hall  john oates,1982,
key largo,bertie higgins,1982," Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies
Falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero
And you were my leading lady We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo Honey can't you remember
We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will... play it again
'Cause I love you still
Baby this can't be the end We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo"
