i will come to you,hanson,1998," When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you Oh I will come to you
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
When you don't know how or why, but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin' I will hear your spirit callin'
And I swear that I'll be there come with me
When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you

Oh I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy You won't have to reach out for me I will come to you

I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
We all need somebody we can turn to
Someone who'll always understand

And you need the strength to keep tryin'
I'll reach out and take your hand

one week,barenaked ladies,1998," It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me saying
""Get that together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish
Although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi
'Cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits
You try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow 'cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault, not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait till you say you're sorry Chickity China the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic
Like I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films
'Kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set a' better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

were not making love no more,dru hill,1998," Sure I've been in love a time or two
But in the end I still chose you
No one could ever make me feel this way
That's why it's killing me, what we're going through
Somehow thought 'tween me and you
Our love would stand the test of time and never ever fade But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same Girl I know that things aren't going right
But don't you think it deserves a fight
A love like ours don't happen everyday
And we're losing it right as we speak
And if we don't wake up, it's a memory
A time gone past, a love that sailed away I dream of lovers past and
I see a girl so sad cause
She lost the only man she loved
He went away
Well it's not too late for us
To change"
semicharmed life,third eye blind,1998," Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo... I'm packed and I'm holdin'
I'm smilin', she's livin', she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, comin' over you
Keep on smilin' what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you And I speak to you like the to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said... I want somethin' else, to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want somethin' else, I'm not listenin' when you say good-bye Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo... The sky was gold, it was rose
I was takin' sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smilin' in the pictures you would take
Doin' crystal meth, will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm, I bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
I said... How do I get back there, to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said... I want somethin' else, to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want somethin' else, I'm not listenin' when you say good-bye I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright And when the plane came in, she said she was crashin'
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive, those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress One
And you hold me, and we're broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heading off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not comin' down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now, locked down in a smile
But nothin' is alright, alright
And I want somethin' else, to get me through this life
Baby, I want somethin' else
Not listenin' when you say...
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...
The sky was gold, it was rose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
I was takin' sips of it through my nose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
And I wish I could get back there (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
Someplace back there, in the place we used to start (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)

Because you push me around I'm starting to ignore you
Or I doubted you so long

Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers

P. Diddy name me pretty
Did it for the money, now can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy

Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know

And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The mo shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White Chorus: Busta Rhymes We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggaz is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?
(repeat all 2X) Verse Three: Puff Daddy Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be Verse Four: Notorious B.I.G. We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heatas n the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kids, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggaz step up, we just macin them
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission Chorus 2X w/ Puff talking
Aiyyo, can you hear me out
there?
Aiyyo turn me up, nobody
can hear me out there
That's good, it's all fucked
up now
Y'all know it's all fucked
up now right?
What the fuck y'all gonna
do now?
What I'ma do now?
Can y'all hear me out there?
Can y'all hear me out there? (?) Fuck y'all niggaz wanna do It's all fucked up now
What I'ma do now, huh?
What I'ma do now
It's all fucked up now"
too much,spice girls,1998," Love is blind
as far as the eye can see
deep but meaningless
words to me
Easy lover
I need a friend
road to nowhere twist and turns but will this never end
Well my dear you know that he pleases me
but short term solution ain't no resolution
there ain't no release for me Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel
to keep me satisfied
Unwrap yourself from around my finger hold me too tight or left to linger
something finebuilt to last slipped up there
I guess we're running out of time too fast
Yes my dear you know he soothes me there's no complication there's no explanation
it's just a groove in me Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satified
What part of no don't you understand
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
boy who thinks he can Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel
to keep me satisfied
Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel
to keep me satisfied
Too much of nothing
so why don't we give it a try
too much of something
you're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing
so why don't we give it a try
too much of something
you're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing

Flipmode Squad '98
Raw Deluxe, check it out y'all I be the street hit
The brotha yo momma freak wit
Put yo people on if y'all know how to keep a secret
When I get money ya know I like to keep it
How I get money ya know others are tryin to peep it Flipmode, be the winners ya wanna form a team with
The big money figures to plot da scheme with
The brothas who be used to gettin money frequent
The ones who I'd always measure up my triple beams with Until they start takin my people to the precint
But dats all back in da day yo, that ain't nuttin recent
Cuz now we see women we like to speak with
Eat with, lay 'em down and sleep with Type of woman who make a brotha wanna keep it
Shorty be so exotic she lookin decent
Lotta corny niggaz who be offerin whack free shit
I can't hold the heat no more, yo I gotta release it CHORUS 1:
What y'all gonna do? Don't we always comin through, me and my crew
Lemme hear ya say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!) Say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!) To all my dogs dat stay bloody, well around in the 500, all day
Lemme hear ya say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!) Say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!) Now everytime I meet a sucka dats frontin, it's aight
Gettin money and everybody want it
Smoke a big blunt, get all fucked up
Fall on da floor, gotta call my X-500 Iceburg 5 where you at?
""No need for alarm, right now I'm cruisin' to the sound of my enhanced cd-rom.""
Hurry up 5, things are about to get thick
I see dis cat away behind my back about to do a stick
""Tell me where you at, I will be there in 10 seconds flat, I got your back,
I'll be there just in time to counteract.""
Sometimes I might even forget my crew, my X-5 bulletproof, I turbo boost,
and blast through da ceiling in da roof Comin through, hittin you, and knockin out other sucka's tooths
Full speed ahead, like we runnin a toll booth
Produce more flavour then Veryfine juice
Call a truce on me and my people and let loose CHORUS 2:
All my ladies in da place to be, gettin money while they next to me, lemme see
Lemme hear ya say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!) Say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!) All my people just wave yo hands, gettin money all across da land, one time
Lemme hear ya say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!) Say ""FIRE IT UP""! (FIRE IT UP!)
C'mon Release the heat, we lettin loose to the extreme
Me my Iceburg X-5 bounce from da scene
Recline my seat, rock to da beat
Lyrical artist, microphone scarred up in da heat Blow up da spot we be hittin, know what I mean?
Got you hoppin yo people up like caffeine
Flyin guilloutine, seein everything on my little computer screen
From here to Phillipines Keep it movin, we never run out of gasoline
Gas me, your arson, but lookin kerosene
Me and my five be runnin the mission you never seen
Hot shit, makin ya fuckas forever fein Anyone of you comin, you better come clean
Hit you with a dose of rhyme amphetamine
Got your eyes all bloodshot, ya need visine

ill be,edwin mccain,1998," The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath And emeralds from mountains thrust toward the sky
Never revealing their depth
And tell me that we belong together
And dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life
And rain falls angry on the tin roof
As we lie awake in my bed And you're my survival, you're my livin' proof
My love is alive and not dead
And tell me that we belong together
And dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life
And I dropped out, I burned up
I fought my way back from the dead Tuned in, turned on
Remembered the thing that you, you said
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life
The greatest fan of your life
The greatest fan of your life"
ray of light,madonna,1998," Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder

She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember
Where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when
Earth shall be as one And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone
And I feel... Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel Quicker than a ray of light
She's flying

the mummers dance,loreena mckennitt,1998," When in the springtime of the year
When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak, and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern light CHORUS:
We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay Who will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the year The songs of birds seem to fill the wood
That when the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland days CHORUS And so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone A garland gay we bring you here
And at your door we stand
It is a sprout well budded out
The work of our Lord's hand"
all cried out,allure featuring 112,1998," [Allure]
All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you
Don't you know My tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
Cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you [112]
Crying over you, over you yeah, yes
Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Oh why was I such a fool
(Why was I such a fool)
Oh yeah, now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong, yeah [Allure]
Leaving me all alone Don't you know
My tears will cause an inferno
Romance of these flames
Why should I take the blame
You were the one who left me neglected [112]
I'm so sorry baby [Allure]
Apology not accepted
Add it to the broken hearts you collected
I, I gave you all of me [112]
Gave you all of me [Allure]
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
I, I don't know what to do [112]
I don't know what to do [Allure]
Now I'm all cried out [112]
I'm all cried out [Allure]
Over you
I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain And you [112]
You left me so confused [Allure]
Now I'm all cried out

foolish games  you were meant for me,jewel,1998," I hear the clock, it's 6am
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and I've got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off all the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore
Cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know, that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken and more people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie but it just wasn't the same
Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad
Cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know, that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up, and then I turn the sheets down
And then I take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it will be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight
Cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
And I know, you love me
And soon i know you will see
You were meant for me

We are all precious in his sight.
And a rose still and always will be a rose. (Singing:) Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm There was a rose I knew, I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied, played with the truth, hey, hey Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her

She wears her thorns tryin' to forget about you 'Cause a rose is still a rose

Make you and then break you

And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings Oh.oh.yeah
When she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her

Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see your all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on 'Cause a rose is still a rose

4 seasons of loneliness,boyz ii men,1998," Oh yea oh oh oh
I long for the warmth of days gone by when you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you, no matter what I try When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same Remember the nights when we closed our eyes
And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time Anytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same This loneliness has crushed my heart
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness again In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same
Remember the warmth of days gone by"
father,ll cool j,1998," I swear to tell the truth and nothin' but the truth, so help me, God
I just felt like tellin' the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that
If your plane crashed in the water, and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped, my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple, pops caught a attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms 'cause she's talkin' on the phone, come on

Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the door
She said, ""I ain't takin' these whippin's no more
I wanna live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Lookin' down at me, standin' on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin' me?

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty, left Long Isle for Queens
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around, heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screamin' I can't forget that

My head was spinnin', I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops disappeared
Grand pops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started gettin' beatings everyday
Sometimes for goin' outside to play
Late at night, on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishin' the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat me with belts, like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest, stomped me out on the floor
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

But you came along and changed my mind I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say, ""Love wins again"" So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind This time I swear I'm through but if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things So I placed my heart under lock and key

hearing gunshots licking by the hour.
When Too short bumping every super spot
And told us all how to ride for the West Coast To my peoples if you with me where you at
Throw your dubs in the air,
and wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say, all day every day any damn day
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down, going on an on
It don't stop, won't stop, can't stop, nigga ride or die.
That's why I put it down for the West side Didn't seem that long ago, (oh no)
We was stealing 40s out the liquor sto (oh no)
Mama started tripping so it's time to go
Mob to the front with the locstaz
Everybody broke smoking roaches
DJ Quick was the shit, had every nigga clamin he was 4rm
the C-P-T
Y'all remember, Onetime tried to clown
We had to burn this bitch on down One time for my niggaz in incarceration,
I blaze a dime with you, for having lotsa patience
Two times for my sisters at the county buildin
I got some West Side love for all you ghetto children
Three times for my niggaz that done passed away,
I tip some Gin for you, and pray for better days.
One day everything's gonna be fine,
but until that day my only reply, Is West Side till I die To my peoples if you with me where you at
Throw your dubz in the air, and wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say, all day every day any damn day
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down, going on and on
It don't stop, won't stop, can't stop, nigga ride or die.
Got to give it up for the West side From Crenshaw to Foothill Boulevard
All I see is lowlows and mob cars, datins and five stars
All the true hoes is hitting switches
With all the finest riches.
Of course the finest bitches, don't get it twisted.
Ask me what's a real G? Show me a nigga scrappin
back against the wall until his knuckles bleed.
Screaming death to all our enemies, and those who don't believe.
West Coast living be the shit to me. One time for my niggas in incarceration,
I blaze a dime with you, for having lotza patience
Two times for my sisters at the county buildin
I got love for all your little ghetto children
Three times for my niggas that done passed away,
I tip some Gin for you, and pray for better days.
One day everything's gonna be fine...,
but until that day my only reply,
Is West Side till I die To my peoples if you with me where you at

im your angel,r kelly and celine dion,1999," No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray
And then you will see the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry
All you need is time seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day
And then you will see the morning will come
And all of your day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
How can I make you see I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
(The end is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight
(Oh no)
Just put your trust beyond the skies I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are

all star,smash mouth,1999," Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In shape of an ""L"" on her forehead Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense
Not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do
So much to see So what's wrong with taking the back street
You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now
You're an all star
Get your game on
Go play Hey now
You're a rock Star
Get the show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place
And they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now
Wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men
Beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The ice we skate Is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm
So you might as well swim
My world's on fire How about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored Hey now You're an all star
Get your game on
Go play
Hey now
You're a rock star
Get the show on Get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold

You're an all star
Get your game on

You're a rock star Get the show on

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked
Could you spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep What a concept
I could use
A little fuel myself And we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
Didn't make sense
Not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do
So much to see

angel,sarah mclachlan,1999," Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh a beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight In the arms of the Angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the Angel May you find some comfort here So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness Oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees
In the arms of the Angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the Angel
May you find some comfort here
You're in the arms of the Angel
May you find some comfort here"

last kiss,pearl jam,1999," Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?.
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world When I woke up the rain was pourin' down
There were people standin' all around
Something warm flowing through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I had missed Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world"

This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me Some say
Better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say
You were always there for me Someway
When the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time
And fade away
And fade away Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me Someone said you tried too long
Someone said we got it all
Someone said we tried too long
Is there a place where I belong? So far and so long
So far away
So far and so wrong
So far away, away, away Some day
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why
You were always there for me
One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away.
And fade away.
And fade away

If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp I'll hold it with both hands
It' s worth the risk of burning to have a second chance No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together, no, no, no
If we believe that true love never has to end

This is wrong
And baby it's killing me
It's killing you
But both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusted me fast asleep
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you i don't love you
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion
When you start to cry
I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my hearts not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away Pretending i don't love you I know we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life
I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Doctor Zhivago
All my love i'll be sending And you'll never know
'Cause there can be no happy ending It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you i don't love you

I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my hearts not free

summer girls,lfo,1999," Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer? New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer Hip Hop Marmalade spic and span
Met you one summer and it all began
Your the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird Jersey 33 When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer then went back home
Macauly Culkin wasn't Home Alone Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer Cheery Pez, Cold Crush, rock star Boogie
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make girls smile Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you because you rock my world
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow You love hip hop and rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near You love fun dip and cherry coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer In the summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike Bugaloo shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there, oh, so quick
Let you off the hook like my man Mr. Lipit
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it Like the color purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up but what's the use
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose Came in the door said it before
I think I'm over you but I'm really not sure
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer 'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so Summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch

Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere! It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend

You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem

Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out Girls you know you'd better watch out

god must have spent a little more time on you,n sync,1999," Yeah
Yeah
Oh yes
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah Can this be true?
Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel
It's a miracle Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you In all of creations all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Makes me purified Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you On you, on you, on you, you
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yes he did baby)
On you, on you, on you, you
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yeah) Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me?
There's an angel
It's a miracle Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
God must have spent(on you, on you, on you, you)
A little more time
On you...

A little more time
On you"
lullaby,shawn mullins,1999," She grew up with the children of the stars
in the Hollywood hills and the boulevards.
Her parents threw big parties. Everyone was there.
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger and
Sonny and Cher. She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax.
And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't
relax.
And just before she hangs her head to cry,
I sing to her a lullaby
I sing: (chorus)
Everything's gonna be all right.
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye. She still lives with her mom outside the city
down that street about a half a mile.
And all her friends tell her she's so pretty
but she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while.
'Cause even her smile looks like a frown.
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town. (chorus) I told her I ain't so sure about this place.
It's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face.
Seems like everybody's got a plan.
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan. (chorus)"
tell me its real,kci  jojo,1999,
back 2 good,matchbox 20,1999," It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there, I could say so much
But I don't go there 'cause I don't want to
I was thinking, if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so And everyone here knows everyone here is thinking about somebody else
Well it's best if we all keep it under our heads
I couldn't tell if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how to get it back to good This don't mean that you own me
Well, this ain't no good, in fact it's funny as hell
But things worked out just like you wanted to
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try to give me some room
To figure out just what I'm going to do 'Cause everyone here hates everyone here for doing just like they do
And it's best if we all keep this quiet instead
And I couldn't tell why everyone here was doing me like they do
But I'm sorry now
And I don't know how to get it back to good And everyone here is wondering what it's like to be with somebody else
And everyone here's to blame
And everyone here gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain
Yeah, well everyone here hides shades of shame
But looking inside we're the same, we're the same
And we're all grown now
Yeah, but we don't know how to get it back to good But everyone here knows everyone here is thinking 'bout somebody else
And it's best if we all keep this under our heads (yeah, our heads)
Yeah, see, I couldn't tell now, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But it's over now
Yeah I don't know how
Guess it's over now
There's no getting back to good"

Miami the city that keeps the roof blazing Party in the city where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami and Bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm going to Miami, welcome to Miami Yo I heard the rain storms ain't nutin' to mess wit
But I cant feel a drip on the strip, its a trip
Ladies half dressed, fully equipped and they be screamin' out

So I'm thinking I'm a scoop me something hot
In this salsa Merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city and its right on the beach
Temperature, get to ya' its about to reach 500 degrees in the Carribean seas
With the hot mommies screaming ayy papi
Every time I come to town they be spotting me
In the drop Bentley ain't no stoppin' me
So cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo ain't no city in the world like this, and if you ask how I know

Welcome to Miami and Bienvenido a Miami

I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is plan, take a walk on the beach
Draw a heart in the sand give me your hand Damn you look sexy, lets go to Yacth in the west keys
Ride my Jet Skis lounge under the palm trees

hands,jewel,1999," If I could tell the world just one thing
It would be that we're all ok
and not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful
and useless in times like these
I won't be made useless
I won't be idle with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
and I am never broken Poverty stole your golden shoes
But it didn't steal your laughter
and heart ache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after We'll fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing My hands are small I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
and I am never broken In the end only kindness matters
In the end only kindness matters I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray My hands are small I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
and I am never broken My hands are small I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
and I am never broken
We are never broken We are God's eyes
God's hands
God's mind
We are God's eyes

And scatter like ice from the spoon

And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer? You know the lies they always told you
And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you?
That swallowed the light from the sun
Inside your room, yeah... Coming down, the world turned over
And Angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer? And there's no time left for losing
When you stand, they fall, yeah... Coming down, the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder

And Angels fall without you there

steal my sunshine,len,1999," I was lying on the grass on Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged all laced and bugged all twisted wrong and beat
uncomfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar-speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun I know it's up for me
If you stel my sunshine
Making sure I'm not in too deep
If you stel my sunshine
Keeping versed and on my feet
If you stel my sunshine I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street 
l-a-t-e-r that week
My sticky paws were in to making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat 
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun I know it's up for me
If you stel my sunshine
Making sure I'm not in too deep
If you stel my sunshine
Keeping versed and on my feet

faded pictures,case featuring joe,1999," That's right
Life is funny, ain't it?
Sometimes you can end up with
Somebody you really don't wanna be with
And others left to figure it out
Check it She was more than a women a goddess for all to see
All I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were coolin and groovin and love was on
But I still remember how it felt when are love was gone (Ohhhhh) Tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
Secret memories in her mind, how could love be so unkind
Heartbreak time Faded pictures in abroken glass
Like a mirror revealing
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past
'Cause it's breaking my heart
To watch her stare into the glass As she turned through the pages, the tears rolled down her face
I could see her reminiscing, whied her life have to be this way
As she stopped and she came to a page where her diary end
To smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose ohhh Tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
Secret memories in her mind, how could love be so unkind
Heartbreak time Faded pictures in abroken glass
Like a mirror revealing
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past
'Cause it's breaking my heart
To watch her stare into the glass (Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
'Cause she's lost inside the past
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
'Cause she's lost inside the past Faded pictures in abroken glass

back at one,brian mcknight,1999," It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say, âE½That I'd fall neverâE
The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal, yeah
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at one, yeah
It's so incredible the way things work themselves out
And all emotional once you know what it's all about, hey
And undesirable for us to be apart, never would've made it very far
'Cause you know you got the keys to my heart
'Cause
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at one
Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at one"

See if you can somehow factor in
You know there's always more than one way
to say exactly what you mean to say Was I out of my head or was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication, it was hard to find

It's the hard knock life, for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life! From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life! I flow for those 'dro'ed out all my niggas
Locked down in the ten by fo', controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back, daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not I went from lukewarm to hot, sleepin' on futons and cots
To king size dream machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braille
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit

Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it, till the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, x'ed your name out
Put jigga on top, drop albums non-stop for ya, nigga It's the hard knock life, for us

Stay witchu, pray witchu, grow old and gray witchu,
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it

I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils

And I ain't got much else to lose.
I'm faded, flat busted;

when you believe,whitney houston and mariah carey,1999," Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long Before we knew we could, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I cant explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe) Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve) When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe An' though they don't always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in, to your fears But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah, though hope is frail)
Though hope is frail (It's hard)
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, yeah) Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)

You will when you believe (When you)

Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe, just breathe
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way"

My muñequita my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood 'Cause you're so smooth And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name callin' me out Out from the barrio you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round And if you say, ""This life ain't good enough""
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth And it's just like the ocean under the moon

Listen and wait for the Echoes of angels who won't return He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time But he means nothing to you

There's always something more you wish he'd say He's everything you want
He's everything you need He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time But he means nothing to you And you don't know why

And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Into the highway

'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape

Come on, let's go there

to a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
to a place with golden streets?

It helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same The only difference is, to let love replace all our hate

When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is That's the way it is When life is empty,
With no tomorrow,
And loneliness starts to call
Baby don't worry
Forget your sorrow
'Cause love's gonna conquer it all, all When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it (And that's the way it is
When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left to doubt) Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is"

absolutely story of a girl,nine days,2000," This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles... How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope but she only found tears.
And i can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real!
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes!
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror so how do you choose?
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles... How many lovers would stay?
Just to put of with this shit day after day!
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say.
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose!
How do we get there today?
When we're walking to far for the price of our shoes! Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say! This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles... Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say!
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her- This is the story of a girl
Her pretty face she hid from the world!
And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her
This is the story of a - girl!
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles...
When she smiles."

that we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again

the real slim shady,eminem,2000," May I have your attention, please
May I have your attention, please
Will the real Slim Shady, please stand up
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady, please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here
Ya'll act like you never seen, a white person before
Jaws all on the floor, like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass, worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Ahh)
It's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say, what I think he did, did he
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Haha)
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you know what
Flippin' to you know who, yeah but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms (Eh-eh-eh)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green, to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might, just give it a little kiss
And that's the message, that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know, what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade, they got the Discovery Channel don't they
We ain't nothin' but mammals, well some of us are cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man, and another man can't elope (Eww)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chores and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps, to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can, sit me here next to
Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch the chairs so
I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over, who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast, on MTV
Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe
I should download an audio on mp3
And show the whole world, how you gave Eminem VD (Ahh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here, to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk talk and act like me
You just might be, the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it, in front of ya'll
And I don't gotta be false, or sugar-coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, [(Rip)] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids, eat up these albums like Valiums it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person, in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'
In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot circling, screamin' I don't give a fuck
With his windows down, and his system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers, on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind, and outta control
And one more time loud as you can, how's it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up

i wish,carl thomas,2000," It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she was unhappily married with children And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
But she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else It hurts so bad for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me She chose to stay at home
So they could be a family
For the children but what about me? And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
And she still belongs to someone else Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22, either way it hurts
Someone that you lose And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else And I, and I
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else I wish, I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside"

She doesn't care a thing, about that hair
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia She never compromises, loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful
Meet Virginia Well she wants to be the queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
""I don't really wanna be queen"" Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the president And here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the president
Meet Virginia Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back, as she screams
""I don't really wanna live this life"", no, no, no She only drinks coffee at midnight
But the moment is not right
And the time is quite, unusual You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body, unusual Meet Virgina, I can't wait to

Hated on by most these niggas
Wit no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me
'Cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho Please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the OG's?
Eazy-E's, Ice cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said, ""Muthafuck the police"" Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flop
Y'all are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around wit me
And turn me back to the old me Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of NWA
One day I was walkin' by
Wit a walkman on When I caught a guy givin' an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot wit his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin' out wit two broken legs, tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops Imma kill you and them
Loud ass muthafuckin barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through me
Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the chronic two
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit a Charleston chew
*chigga chigga chigga*
Slim Shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men, ladies Sorry Doc, but I've been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailey Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say

You muthafuckas would stop comin' up to me
Wit your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free When my last C.D. was out you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got's new company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of The Compton
I told em all
All them little gangstas
Who you think helped mould 'em all?
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none What you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What 'cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off
I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that I was strapped wit gats
When you were cuddling a cabbage patch Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say

thats the way,jo dee messina,2000," Everybody wants an easy ride,
On the merry-go-round that we call life.
Take a drive on cruise control,
Then you wait to find it's a winding road.
I had my dreams in view,
When the money ran out and the engine blew.
Hung my tears out to dry,
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky. And I, I was walkin' the clouds.
Feelin' so safe and sound.
Somethin' else knocks me down. Well, oh, that's the way it is!
You gotta roll with the punches.
That's the way it goes!
You gotta bend when the wind blows.
You live you learn,
You crash and burn.
It's hit or miss. (That's the way)
And that's the way it is. One fine day you wake up,
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love.
He's just what you're lookin' for,
The only problem is, that the man's not sure.

the best day,george strait,2000," We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
'Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now its me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life I'm the luckiest man alive

Have to find what life is like without you

but you over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
and I played my guitar too loud Chorus:
How do you like me now
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?! When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
You never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and your always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'

Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'

Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on tv
Met her at a gala affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt outta place as she looked into my eyes
Sher hand around 9 pm and now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never have to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shoobie-do-wop and scooby snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheesy
I think I fell for the girl on tv

From all of my sadness
the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life... Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight. Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never.
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever.
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on... Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long. Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.

I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life and
I think I'm scared
I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone, baby you need to come home, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the room just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here

let me blow ya mind,eve featuring gwen stefani,2001," Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you havin' hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, head back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all aint writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you aint Gisell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I aint goin' nowhere
It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You aint a ganster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me Now why you grittin your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Aint no stress when it comes to sayin' ""Get what you see""
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe?
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I aint scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach, wishin I wrote your rhymes And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I aint goin' nowhere
It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, block shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete(Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, cuz I crush anything I land on
Me here, aint no mistake, nigga, it was planned on And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door

It took a while to get me here

thank you,dido,2001," My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it' d all be grey
But your picture on my wall it reminds me
That it's not so bad, it's not so bad I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again and even if I'm there
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad And I want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking
Through and through then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you, and even if my house falls
Down now, I wouldn't have a clue because you're
Near me And I want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life And I want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life

I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down.
Until you cried... never All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again At every time, I've always known

it wasnt me,shaggy featuring rikrok,2001," Yo man
Yo
Open up man
What do you want man?
My girl just caught me
You let her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen With who?
The girl next door, you know? Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key All this time she was standing there She never took her eyes off me
How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim And you tell her baby no way
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder
(It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her
(It wasn't me) Heard the screams getting louder
(It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what she was about to see
Why should she believe me when I told her it wasn't me
Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on
Da right prefix whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying about things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Your answer: go over there but if she pack a gun
You know you better run fast
But she caught me on the counter
(It wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa

I even had her in the shower

Creeping with the girl next door

Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed

its been awhile,staind,2001," And it's been awhile, since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile, since I first saw you
And it's been awhile, since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile, since I could call you
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered I stretched myself beyond my means
And it's been awhile, since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile, since I can say I love myself as well And it's been awhile, since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again
Why must I feel this way? Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day And it's been awhile, since I could look at myself straight And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile, since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father

You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me

See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two

drive,incubus,2001," Sometimes
I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear And I
Can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
Take the wheel and steer
It's driven me before and seems to have a vague Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yea
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there So, if I
Decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of
The hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Aah ah ooo It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that when
I drive myself my light is found Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yea
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yea
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there

what would you do,city high,2001," Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hoping to die
She said-nigga I know about pain cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life Hold up!
What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby you can do it What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life"

She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real

(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about? Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
