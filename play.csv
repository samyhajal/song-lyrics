Everything's waiting for you. Don't hang around and let your problems surround you

where they never close downtown. Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over happy again.

Didn't you?
People call
Say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you
You used to Laugh about Everybody that was Hangin' out Now you don't
Talk so loud
Now you don't
Seem so proud About having to be scrounging
Your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah, you've Gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna
Have to get
Used to it
You say you never
Compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you
Realize
He's not selling any Alibis
As you stare into the vacuum
Of his eyes
And say
""Do you want to
Make a deal?""
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah, you
Never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't
Let other people
Get your
Kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your
Diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a
Siamese cat
Ain't it hard
When you discover that
He really wasn't
Where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To have on your own
No direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah
Princess on the steeple and all the
Pretty people they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they
Got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better
Take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, babe
You used to be
So amused
At Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used
Go to him now
He calls you
You can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin'
You got
Nothin' to lose
You're invisible now
You got no secrets
To conceal
How does it feel
Ah, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?"

now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
for now i have to tell you everyday
My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
softer than a sigh
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean
wider than the sky
my love is brighter than the brightest star
that shines every night above
and there is nothing in this world
that can ever change my love
my love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
softer than a sigh
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean
wider than the sky
my love is brighter than the brightest star
that shines every night above
and there is nothing in this world
that can ever change my love"

The morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball. You never cared for secrets I'd confide.
For you I'm just an ornament,
Something for your pride. Always running, never caring,
That's the life you live.
Stolen minutes of your time
were all you had to give. And I think it's gonna be all right.

The morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball. The story's in the past with nothing to recall.
I've got my life to live and I
don't need you at all The roller coaster ride we took is
nearly at an end.
I bought my ticket with my tears,
that's all I'm gonna spend. And I think it's gonna be all right.

i am a rock,simon  garfunkel,1966," A winter's day
In a deep and dark December;
I am alone,
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I am a rock,
I am an island. I've built walls,
A fortress deep and mighty,
That none may penetrate.
I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock,
I am an island. Don't talk of love,
But I've heard the words before;
It's sleeping in my memory.
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
If I never loved I never would have cried.
I am a rock,
I am an island. I have my books
And my poetry to protect me;
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.
I touch no one and no one touches me.
I am a rock,
I am an island. And a rock feels no pain;
And an island never cries."

the sound of silence,simon  garfunkel,1966," Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly, creeping
Left its seeds while I was, sleeping
And the vision, that was planted in my brain... still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound, of silence
And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs, that voices never shared
No one dared
Disturb the sound, of silence
""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows""
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed, in the wells, of silence
And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls,
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds, of silence"""
lady godiva,peter and gordon,1966," Seventeen, a beauty queen
She made a ride that caused a scene
In the town Her long blonde hair
Hangin' down around her knees
All the cats who dig striptease
Prayin' for a little breeze
Her long blonde hair
Falling down across her arms
Hiding all the lady's charms
Lady Godiva She found fame and made her name
A hollywood director came into town
And said to her
""How'd you like to be a star?""
""You're a girl that could go far""
""'specially dressed the way you are""
She smiled at him
Gave her pretty head a shake
That was Lady G's mistake
A-hey-hey-hey
Lady Godiva He directs certificate 'X'
And people now are craning their necks
To see her
'cause she's a star
One that everybody knows
Finished with the striptease shows
Now she can't afford her clothes Her long blonde hair
Lyin' on the barber's floor
Doesn't need it long anymore

homeward bound,simon  garfunkel,1966,
did you ever have to make up your mind,the lovin spoonful,1966," Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind? Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide? Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind? Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says ""Better go home, son, and make up your mind""
Then you bet you'd better finally decide!
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?"

almost persuaded,david houston,1966," Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips coal black hair and eyes
That would tempt any man Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside Then we danced and she whispered I need you
Take me away from here and be my man
Then I've looked into her eyes
And I saw it, the reflection of my wedding band And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home"

I was feeling kinda seasick
The crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale She said, ""There is no reason
And the truth is plain to see""
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale"
dont you care,the buckinghams,1967," If you don't love me
Why don't you tell me?
Instead of runnin' around
With all the other guys in town Can't you see
You're hurtin' me?
Don't you care?
Don't you care? If you don't want me
Why don't you tell me?
Instead of tellin' lies
And makin' me cry Can't you see
You're hurtin' me?
Don't you care?
Don't you care? What ever happened
To all the good times
We used to have The times we cried
And laughed
I wanna know, I wanna know Will you ever love me again
Or will I find out
That this is the end?
Don't you care?
Mmm, my, my, my, my, baby You said that you'd believe me
Then why'd you ever leave me?
I'm standin' here all alone
Without a girl of my own Can't you see
You're hurtin' me?
Don't you care?
Don't you care? Don't you care?
Don't you care?
Don't you care? Don't you care?
Don't you care?
Don't you care?"
then you can tell me goodbye,the casinos,1967," (John D. Loudermilk) Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye. Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
After you've loved me for a million years
If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye. If you must go I won't grieve
If you'll just wait a lifetime before you leave
But if you must go I won't say no
Just so we can say that we try Tell me you love me for a million years
If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye.
Then you can tell me goodbye..."
