My soul you took away

I know you did I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again Hold me
Hold me

Say it just one time
Say you love me

Love you

What a mighty good man I wanna take a minute or two and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it, get me involved in that he said, she said crowd I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh

A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion Yeah, the ritual, highway to Heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like seven eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin' and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cuz good men are hard to find What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

He's not a wham bam thank you ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cuz his Mama taught him that What a man, what a man, what a man

Moves us all in turn

And we damn good too but you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean to earn your keep. REGULATORS, mount up! It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213 So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said, ""I'm stuck"" Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said, ""Damn, what's next?"" They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down They got guns to my head, I think, I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N A T E and me, the Warren to the G Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help the Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""Ooo I like your size"" She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble Chords, strings
We brings melody
G-Funk, where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm If you know like I know

Get out from this shell, girl I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know that all I really want is you Sorry if you felt misled but I know what I feel
I know what I said, baby
God I hope you believe, believe in all that we can be
The future in us, together in love You're the reason I'm strong
Don't you think I don't know
This is where I belong, give me the time
To say that you're mine, to say that you're mine If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know that all I really want is you
All I really want is you If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know that all I really want is you Tried to find myself, tried to find the truth
Get out from this shell, girl I'm almost there
So let me show you, so let me show you If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know that all I really want is you
If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know that all I really want is you
If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know that all I really want is you"

Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain

So many reasons in so many ways

all i wanna do,sheryl crow,1994," Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A. ""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me 'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you, that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard"

because of love,janet jackson,1994," When the white flag sails, covered in streaks of blood

We shed so many dreams, I'll let them fade away In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
Be ashamed of the trail behind us

Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life When the water spills, the glass will break
It drips like tears, running up your face
And the hounds will cry, for the dance of war
But the sons of joy, their victory will soar

We shed so many dreams, I'll let them fade away In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
Be ashamed of the trail behind us

Don't let it burn, don't let it fade

Is tearing me apart
Is ruining everything And I swore, I swore I would be true
And, honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you? But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, uh-huh-huh
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to
Do you have to let it linger? Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong
I was wrong If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie

And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you And I'm in so deep

loser,beck,1994," In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double-barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phoney gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
That's chokin' on the splinters Soy un perdedor

keep ya head up,2pac,1994," Little somethin' for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corinne Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then, the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block, brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'cause sista you don't need him And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy, (what's that)
When brothas make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one! So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies,
But keep your head up (Keep ya head up) Oooh, child things are gonna get easier
(Keep ya head up) Oooh, child things'll get brighter
(Keep ya head up) Oooh, child things are gonna get easier
(Keep ya head up) Oooh, child things'll get brighter Ayyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly, the ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryna make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from getting wewter
You know it's funny when it rains, it pours They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said, there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is, there ain't no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turnin' my brother into a black baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up Huh, ya got to keep your head up Oooh, child things are gonna get easier
(Keep ya head up) Oooh, child things'll get brighter (Keep ya head up) Oooh, child things are gonna get easier
(Keep ya head up) Oooh, child things'll get brighter And uhh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord, for my kids, even if nobody else want em
'cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'Cause ain't nuttin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week
'cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please, you got to keep your head up"

You want to shut out the night, you want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart
Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it Remember everything that I told you
and I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid, and you're completle amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do
keep on believing, and you'll discover baby There's always something magic,
there's always something new
And when you really really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always true
And when you really really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
For you Once upon a time was a backbeat,
once upon a time all the chords came to life
And the angels had guitars even before thay had wings
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it Remember everyghing that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
You're never alone cause you can put on the phones
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do
Keep on believing, and you'll discover baby There's always something magic,
there's always something new
And when you really really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always true
And when you really really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
For you The beat is yours forever -
- that's when rock and roll dreams come through (5x)"
amazing,aerosmith,1994," I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin to walk through
The pain When I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave, but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I Would die It's Amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's Amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright It's Amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay
Alive It's Amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's Amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's Amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
desperate hearts - desperate hearts

beautiful in my eyes,joshua kadison,1994," You're my peace of mind
In this crazy world.
You're everything I've tried to find
Your love is a pearl. You're my Mona Lisa
You're my rainbow skies And my only prayer is that you realize
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes.
The world will turn
And the seasons will change And all the lesson we will learn
Will be beautiful and strange.
We'll have our fill of tears Our share of sighs.
And my only paryer is that you realize
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes. You will always be beautiful in my eyes.
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow Ever more beautiful in my eyes.
When there are lines upon my face
From a lifetime of smiles When the time comes to embrace
For one long last while
We can laugh about how time really flies.
We won't say goodbye 'cause true love never dies. You'll always be beautiful in my eyes.
You will always be beautiful in my eyes.
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes.
The passing years will show that you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes."

Leavin' bodies buried in the ground {...rest in peace...}

now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
but don't you be calling out my name
i bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
that's why i'm talking, one day i was walking down the block
i had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
i walked past these dudes when they passed me
one of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
i turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
then the little one said (yeah me bitch) and laughed
since he was with his boys he tried to break fly

i was too blind to see just how it was affecting me

and i was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
but i don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
by daddy smacking mommy all around

prayer for the dying,seal,1994," Da da, da da Ah, ho-oo-oh-oo Fearless people,
Careless needle.
Harsh words spoken,
And lives are broken. Forceful ageing,
Help me I'm fading.
Heaven's waiting,
It's time to move on. Crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
Life carries on... it goes on. Just say die,
And that would be pessimistic.
In your mind,
We can walk across the water.
Please don't cry,
It's just a prayer for the dying.
I just don't know what's got into me. Been crossin' that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
...learned... Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
...burned burned... I may not know what you're going through,
But time is the space,
Between me and you. There is a light through that window
...light through that window...
Hold on say yes, while people say no Life carries on
...on on on...
Ohh!
It goes on... oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho oh... I'm crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned...
I'm playing with fire,
And not getting burned...
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
There is a light through that window.
Hold on say yes, while people say no 'Cause life carries on... oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho on...
It goes on... oh-ee-on,
It goes on.
Whoah.
Whoah.
Life carries on. When nothing else matters. When nothing else matters. I just don't know what's got into me. It's just a prayer for the dying.

everyday,phil collins,1994," I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothin' more 2 say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay
So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everythin' about you?
But everyday I say, ""I'll try to make my heart be still""
'Til then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by and everyday I fall
It makes me wonder why?
My life's worth nothing without you
But everyday I say, ""I'll try to make my heart be still""
'Cos every way there is to cry ourselves to sleep, we will
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see
The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as I may
I can't stop thinkin' about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you
But everyday I say, ""I'll try to make my heart be still""
'Til then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will
Everyday, everyday, you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday, it gets a little harder
Everyday, everyday, you know I try so hard

dont take the girl,tim mcgraw,1994," Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishing
when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go
but someday you'll change your mind And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Timmy Thompson
take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl Same old boy, same sweet girl
ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to there
won't be any harm And Johnny said
Take my money, take my wallet
take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please, don't take the girl Same old boy, same sweet girl
five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine
but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fading fast and, Johnny hit his knees And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me
take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please, don't take the girl

You got me thinking
I want your love I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me
word is born, you be ignoring me I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
And catch you the next day When I'm in focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low pro-file type I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one I want to know cause if I don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love I'm steady, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
And I want some So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A brother to get got
I'm not your man But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me I got to hear it from your girls, Uptown
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me Got me waiting, anticipating

I want your love ""Hey, yo, hey, yo...""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
""Hey, yo, hey, yo...""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party I never stumble cause I'm humble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
Emotional trips
Get a grip
Because I'm losing it
Ideas was clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already But I'm a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you

You got me thinking
I want your love"
december 1963 oh what a night,the four seasons,1994," Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
Hey, my
As I recall, it ended much too soon Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night Oh, I
Got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
Hey, my
As I recall, it ended much too soon Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night Oh, I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)

always,bon jovi,1994," This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine

I didn't mean to treat you bad

Some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway
And so maybe

As you falter down to the ground
And then someday
Your friends they stand beside as you were flying
Oh you were flying oh so high But then someday people look at you for what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then some day we could take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us But you left me far behind Now maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain No, no, no
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I live with what I've known
And then maybe we might share in something rare
But won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone
But then someday comes
Tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon you should have told me
But you left me far behind
Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had

Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder love came to an end And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know, who don't know We fell apart, the bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared, they didn't help
Makes me wonder, should we blame ourselves? So here we are, broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody said to let it end
Well it makes me wonder we can't let them win And our feelings

runaround,blues traveler,1995," Once upon a midnight dreary
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humour me and tell me lies
Yeah humour me and tell me lies And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby let's keep in touch But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme so don't feed me a line
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down Tra la la la la bomba dear this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do
Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full Oh I like coffee
And I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay
So be that way
I hope and pray
That there's something left to say
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down"

always,bon jovi,1995," This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind

She says ""Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind"" She never lets me in
Only tells me where she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I said that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away
And just Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Let her be This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying ""baby, maybe I'll be back someday""
I wanted to look for you
You walked in; I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer
And felt sorry for myself, sayin' Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Let her be Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Ahh... Last night, I tried to leave
Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin'
""Oh mama, please help me!
Won't you hold my hand and...?"" Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me

That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay
But I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way I've been seeing Lisa now, for a little over a year
She says she's never been so happy, but Lisa lives in fear
That one day Daddy's gonna find out that she's in love
With a Nigger from the streets
Oh how he would lose it then, but she's still here with me
Cuz she believes that love will see it through
One day he'll understand
He'll see me as a person, not just a black man
'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find a way
Love will find the way
Love will find the way
Love will find the way"

colors of the wind,vanessa williams,1995," You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other,
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind"

as i lay me down,sophie b hawkins,1995," It felt like spring time on this February morning
In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy I wonder why (ooh la kah koh) when the sun comes out again (ooh la kah koh)

Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone,
I'm the only one Please, baby, can't you see I'm trying to explain
I've been here before, and I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away

And I'm wishing you were here with me
Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do If only you were here

dear mama,2pac,1995," You are appreciated When I was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin' from the police that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was the black queen mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it, there's no way I could pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady, don't ya know we love ya (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin' home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Just workin' with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving But now the road got rough, you're alone Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I could pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady, don't ya know we love ya (And dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I could pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't ya know we love ya (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady, lady, lady"

Roll to me And look into your heart, pretty baby
Is it aching with some nameless need?
Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Right then, roll to me And I don't think I have ever seen
A soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there? So don't try to deny it, pretty baby
You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining, it's the
Right time to roll to me
Roll to me
Roll to me And I don't think I have ever seen
A soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there? So look around your world, pretty baby

War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later But love
I believe in love I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone Without love
I believe in love Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here

The vendors and the dealers they crowded around me Have I been blind
Have I been lost inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized mesmerized by what my eyes have seen Well I've walked these streets
In a spectacle of wealth and poverty
In the diamond market
The scarlet welcome carpet that they just rolled out for me And I've walked these streets
In the madhouse asylum they can be
Where a wild eyed misfit prophet on a traffic island stopped
And he raved of saving me Have I been blind
Have I been lost inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized mesmerized by what my eyes have seen Have I been wrong
Have I been wise to shut my eyes and play along
Hypnotized paralyzed by what my eyes have found

all i wanna do,sheryl crow,1995," Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A. ""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me 'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you, that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard"

this aint a love song,bon jovi,1995," Should've seen it coming when roses died
Should've seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should've listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how you never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are ""know-it-alls"" and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried, there were nights that died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I've got for you is gone
If the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong -This ain't a love song
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades
Some things never change
It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us, baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving, ohhh
If the love that I've got for you is gone
If the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - This ain't a love song
Woo ooh

I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

Niggaz Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
Bitches Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""
Check it out, uhh
Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot?
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin and dabbin shit
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire, from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
G'wan grit ya teeth, g'wan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killings, be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, thick like Luke dancers
Niggaz grab your gats, bitches take a glance at
The little one, pullin over in the Land Rover
Playin Big Willie style with a chaffeur, yaknahmean?
Stack the green, read all between the lines
A nigga act up, makes the bastard hard to find
Niggaz Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
Bitches Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""

Bitches Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""
(How ya livin Biggie Smalls?) I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smokin skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin ya bastards
Big Poppa never softenin
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin
Leave the fucker coughin up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covered the wife, kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whippin my ride, countin my one's, thinkin I'm richest
Just the way players play, all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin niggaz since Run and them was singin 'Here We Go'
Snatchin ropes at the Roxie homeboy you didn't know
My flow, detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my Mac-10
My target, all you wack niggaz who started rappin
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggaz know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?
Niggaz Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
Bitches Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""

Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""
I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggaz backs
Nines in the stores, glocks in the bags
Maxin mini markets, gettin money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits, niggaz grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, excluse subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the rilli with my peeps all day
325'S roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
Cause they all in line screamin one more time
Niggaz, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches rub-a-dub in the back of the club, straight up"
feel me flow,naughty by nature,1995," You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
lyrically splittin dismissin
I'm on a mission of just hitting
now it's written and kitten hittin wit mittens
I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are
full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really 1-So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixins that ain't fittin to be hittin.
On nothin splittin things that's bitten
And gettin written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off
Before you even started so what
So long see you fly by my try how else
Could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye.
(rpt 1, 1) The flow pro poetical with skills only
A vet'll know better know where's
The wetter flow that'son point like
Decimals manhandlin new crews
Partying with the Zoo Crew
Looking for the pink in poo poo.

Jammin ta while we plannin ta jam

Amateur damager managin damagin mics
Men and even mannequins.
You're a fan again now I wanna know whose the man again?
Naughty's back like vertibrates word to hey-a-ho
The way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang
(rpt 1, 1) Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
The beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up get up
Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up.
Shakes shows until they fizz up
RZA like your with us if not zip up
You lip up whip up.
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back cause we heard
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty I'm Naughty.

the sweetest days,vanessa williams,1995," You and I in this moment, holding the night so close
Hanging on still unbroken, while outside the thunder rolls Listen now, you can hear our heart beat
Warm against life's bitter cold... these are the days
The sweetest days we'll know There are times that scare me, that rattle the house like wind
Both of us so unbending, we battle the fear within
All the while, life is rushing by us hold it now and dont let go
These are the days, the sweetest days we'll know So we whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars til they're gone
And when even the memories have all faded away
These days go on and on Listen now you can hear our heartbeat
Hold me now and don't let go
These are the days
Every day is the sweetest day we'll know The sweetest days we'll know"

That you don't fall in love overnight, oh yeah
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love, ""Goodbye"" But I guess I'm only brokenhearted
Life's not over I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over No more empty conversations
Next time I will be totally sure, oh yeah
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry That I guess I'm only brokenhearted
Life's not over I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted

til you do me right,after 7,1995," Written by babyface, melvin edmonds, kevon edmonds (1995)
Performed by after 7 I was in love with you
And gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your
Love to me at all I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
But you said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done
To make you be so rough til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even want to hear you speak my name
til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothin' good is gonna come til you change
Change your ways
Until you change your evil ways Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breakin' my heart
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel
I don't understand why you've been so wrong I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise so
We could get along
I gave my love to you despite
Your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me there's only
One thing left to say Hook There's a time when you know what you
Feel inside your heart
It's tellin' you that somethin' feels strange
You don't have to deny it
All you gotta do is just try it
You'll find our love grows
Stronger if you're willing to change Hook 2 times"

True to the 1st just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and 20's and 50's
The 1st be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine fool, and I'm working late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
Cuz I got them rocks for them pipes
Come come with them ease
I gotta get paid on the 1st, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs, Poetic Hustlas in the graveyard shift
On the 1st"
like the way i do,melissa etheridge,1995," Is it so hard to satisfy your senses
You found out to love me you have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right you say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do? Baby tell me does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me does she miss you, existing just to kiss you, like the way I do?
Tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you like the way I do? Can I survive... all the implications?
Even if I tried... could you be less than an addiction?
Don't you think I know... there's so many others.
Who would beg, steal and lie, fight, kill and die
Just to hold you, hold you like I do Baby tell me does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me does she miss you, existing just to kiss you, like the way I do?
Tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you like the way I do? Nobody loves you like the way I do
Nobody wants you like the way I do
Nobody needs you like the way I do
Nobody aches, nobody aches just to hold you like the way I do No, no, no
Tell me does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Baby, baby, tell me does she miss you, existing just to kiss you, like the way I do?
No, tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you, baby, like the way I do?
No, like the way I do, oh oh yeah"

dream about you,stevie b,1995," There was a time in my life
When I opened my eyes and there you are,
You were more than a dream,
I could reach out a touch you,
Girl that was long ago.
There are something's that I guess I'll never know,
When you love someone
You got to learn to let them go. When I dream about you,
That's when everything's all right,
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever.
When I dream about you,
Boy you never go away,
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams
Cause I still love, loving you. How can I get you to see
That I'm falling apart
Since you've been gone,
I can never be sure
I could ever let go
Your love is much too strong,
There are something's that I guess I'll never know,
When you love someone
You got to learn to let them go. When I dream about you,
That's when everything's all right,
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever.

i miss you,n ii u,1995," Yeah, this right here goes out to everyone
that has lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out... Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they came to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream
In the future can't wait to see if you
Open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometimes, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath I know you're still livin' your life after death Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take What a bond to break
I'll be missing you It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you Somebody tell me why...
On that morning
When this life is over I know, I'll see your face Every night I pray (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)

Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent

Miles of windless sumkmer nights Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say it, say it again

Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
Say it, say it again

its all coming back to me now,celine dion,1996," There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, Baby, Baby
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And if we"
change the world,eric clapton,1996," If I could reach the stars, pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart, so you could see the truth
That this love I have inside is everything it seems
But for now I find, it's only in my dreams And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world If I could be king even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule this kingdom we had made 'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day
That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
I could change the world I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good

hey lover,ll cool j,1996," I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You are all a real man can need
And ever ask for, this is love
This is more than a crush It was all up at Rutgers, I saw with your man
Smiling, a coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coup with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that
So skated off as you strolled off
Looking at them legs, god damn they looked so soft
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition You only knew about 5 months
Besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
And I've been workin' out everyday thinkin' 'bout you
Lookin' at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin' flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I had a crush in years Hey lover Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tonging you down with vanilla ice cream Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams can turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead Hey lover Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision, it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travellin' the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife no longer my girl Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into a ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control But its a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man still love you
So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time Hey, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush"

How do you block the sound
Of a voice you'd know anywhere? Oh, I really should have known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes

The expression on your face that told me

After the warmest touch?
How do you slow your blood
After the body rush? How do you free your soul

name,goo goo dolls,1996," And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Got tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Got lost or thrown away And now we're grown up orphans
And never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
But you could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are We grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell em' your name
Oooh, oooh, oooh
I won't tell em' your name
Ow! I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same

counting blue cars,dishwalla,1996," Must've been mid afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and
He walked with a purpose
In his sneakers, down the street
He had many questions
Like children often do
He said: Tell me all your thoughts on God
Tell me am I very far Must've been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars
Skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions
Like children often do
We said: Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'm on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far
Am I very far now? It's getting cold, picked up the pace!
How our shoes make hard noises in this place!
Our clothes are stained
We pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions
Like children often do Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'm on my way to see her
So tell me, am I very far?
We're not very far now
We're not very far now
We're not very far now

With the memories that can't be erased
Although we need each other
Things have changed, it's not the same Sometimes it makes me wonder
Where would I be
If you hadn't discovered which I did
Inside of me I know there was something
That we could compare Oh, well, I never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well I, only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life Remembering the good times
From a portrait hung on high
It's filled with so much color
And the laughter we left behind I made the choice and you couldn't decide
I made the choice, I was wrong you were right
Deep down inside, I apologize Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well I, only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life Well, I never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well I, only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life Though I made plans with you
To always have time for you
Before you walk out of my life
I guess it's true, cannot live without you
Don't ever go away, ooh oh yeah Never meant to cause you no pain

Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all the kindness gone?

To hymns of offering.
Have we eyes to see
That love is gathering?
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one, into one So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City

Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed
To the earth below (...)
Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store Morphine city slippin' dues down to see
That we don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go Beneath the sound of hope
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made I know you better than you fake it to see
That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed
To the earth below
The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around"

time,hootie  the blowfish,1996," Time, why you punish me?
Like a wave crashing into the shore
You wash away my dreams
Time, why you walk away?
Like a friend with somewhere to go
You left me crying Can you teach me about tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow, running free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in time Time, I don't understand
Children killing in the street
Dying for the color of a rag
Time, take their red and blue
Wash them in the ocean, make them clean
Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight Can you teach me about tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow, running free?
But tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in... Time is wastin', time is walkin'
(Time, time) You ain't no friend of mine
(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'
(Time, time) I think I'm out of my mind...
Thinkin' about time
And if I die tomorrow, yeah
Just lay me down to sleep Oh, no no, no no Time is wastin', time is walkin'
(Time, time) You ain't no friend of mine
(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'
(Time, time) I think I'm out of my mind...
Thinkin' about time Time, you left me standing there,
Like a tree growin' all alone
The wind just stripped me bare, stripped me bare
Time, the past has come and gone
The future's far away
Well, now only lasts for one second, one second Can you teach me about tomorrow,
And all the pain and sorrow, running free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day,
And I don't believe in time (Time, time, time, time) You ain't no friend of mine
(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'
(Time, time) I think I'm out of my mind
(Time) Walkin', (Time) wasted,
(Time, time) You ain't no friend of mine
(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'
(Time, time) No, no no no Time without courage, time without fear
is just wasted, wasted, wasted time
Oh... Time, why you punish me?"
youll see,madonna,1996," You think that I can't live
Without your love, you'll see
You think I can't go on another day You think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see, somehow, someway You think that I can't
Never laugh again, you'll see
You think that you've
Destroyed my faith in love You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see, somehow, someday All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see You think that you are strong
But you are weak, you'll see
It takes more strength to cry
Admit defeat I have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see, somehow, someday All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
I'll stand on my own
I won't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me

last night,az yet,1996," Last night you were so into it
You told me secrets that you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and yet, oh, so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my mind slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight in your soul You felt incredible, I started to explode I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Sunlight, red, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes And I'm so, I'm so in love
Last night, I was inside of you Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you, baby
Last night, I was inside of you Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you, baby

hook,blues traveler,1996," It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks Because the Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I refer
To familiar heroes from long ago No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow Was that Hook brings you back I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely Suck it in suck it in suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin
To see
What you're doing to me this MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So desperately I sing to thee
Of love
Sure but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried well no in fact I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide
I'll do as I'll decide and let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute diddys
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all your cities to the ground
I've found
I will not mess around
Unless I play then hey
I will go on all day. Hear what I say
I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because
The Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hoooooook
On that you can rely"

old man and me when i get to heaven,hootie  the blowfish,1996," Well an old man said to me
In a voice filled with pain
Where you going young man
Said I'm going to fight a war
Gonna fight for my country
In some foreign land
He said ""The sun will never hurt you
Never harmed anyone
But you must realize""
If you try to stare her down
She will win in the end
She will burn your eyes
She will burn them
Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven
He said ""Boy I was young once
Yeah I was tough
Sailing on Uncle Sam's boat
Hey I could kill the enemy
I could die on foreign streets
But I could not vote
But now you walk by me
You won't talk to me
Say this is my fate
But every time you walk the streets boy
Most of them you meet
You see it's you they hate
It's you...
Seen a million faces
Seen a million places die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven
I hope I get there
Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get there
See this woman sitting next to me
She's been there for a long, long time
And when I fell, she picked me up
When I cried, she wiped my tears
I thank god she's mine
And when I leave this world
She won't have anything
But her love for me
'Cause the man took everything else
Made me hate myself
So just let her be boy
Won't you let her be"
if it makes you happy,sheryl crow,1996,
as i lay me down,sophie b hawkins,1996," It felt like spring time on this February morning
In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy I wonder why (ooh la kah koh) when the sun comes out again (ooh la kah koh)
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again oh
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again mmh (ooh la kah koh)

keep on keepin on,mc lyte featuring xscape,1996," B-Boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper.
Before I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot?
Surely I can, if you the man.
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice.
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang
get it on.
You're gettin' warm.
I can feel you getting closer.
Now baby, down this Mimosa.
You better believe it's time to give a toast to.
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played.
Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade.
All over your body.
Who's body?
You're body.
I can rock a party like nobody.
Leavin' time to take home the loot.
Choosy about who I let knock my boots.
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte.
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right.
[CHORUS:]
Keep On' Keepin On, Cause you came and you changed my world.
Your love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin it right, right,
right... Ah, ah, ah...
Beware of the stare when I step into peace.
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released.
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes.
I found me a new nigga this year.
That know's how to handle this here.
Now I look forward to goin' home at night.
Brother does mo right.
Under the candlelight. Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
I guess I can.
Can I, why not?
If I wanna guess I can. Can I?
More honey than a bumble-bee hive.
Pulling 69 ways in my archive.
Sweet like licorice.
Sugar for my booga.
Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee.
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check.
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat.
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to.
As I procede to Open up and feed you.
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be.
Been I can, I get rid of all company.
[CHORUS]
Many have tried strict regulation.
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation.
Those that didn't perform well.
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell.
You're playing with my time.
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me.
You better work me.
While you got the oppurtunity.
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E.
Only the strong survive.
Only the wise excel.
Once said by my born-in-hell.
Only the lonely die slowly.
Left all alone try to control me.
Easy does it never ask how was it.
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets.
Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute.
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot.
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it.
Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it.
It's natural. Never be ashamed.
Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game."

po pimp,do or die featuring twista,1996," Chorus: johnny p Do you wanna riiide?
In the backseat, of a caddy
Chop it up, with do or die
Do you wanna riiide?
In the backseat, of a caddy
Chop it up, with do or die Verse one: belo Seven double oh p.m.
Fly low to them hoes in the b-m
Sippin seagram, chewin on a weed stem
Touchin on my fo' fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beepin this po pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe
To the crib Verse two: ak-47, belo Seven deuce five, the ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour
Like we runnin up on some ri-vals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly 'lo
Introduce myself
A to the motherfuckin k finna recognize
Then I loose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uhh, pass it to the left and umm
Self-centered niggaz'll take two pulls 'cause they thinkin about samplin umm
P-i, m-p, ology, but logically
We learnin these hoes biology, and obviously, well... Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the c-a
D-i, double-l, with ah a-c, a-c hoes
They peep those, p-i, m-p, and they think that automatically
Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M-o, n-e, but why?
Cause nigga be sportin nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels girbaud flexin one five oh (chop chop)
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fuckin with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat
Let's have me in the cab betcha mess with ya young ass
Smokin on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P-i, m-p, ology, but logically
We learnin these hoes biology, and obviously, well... Verse three: tung twista Well a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spittin mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the oprah lips and the provokin hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
I been lookin in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when outta me gotta be
Right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk c'mon suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of dem my fellas on the train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your hoe
Tryin ta come up on another g
The broad all up under me tryin ta smother me
Lookin love-ly while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbin me with lotion
Comin like an ocean coastin have a cig thinking
Me and do or die dig drinkin love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be givin women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't trickin the feds or spittin game but it's chicken and bread
Kickin them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words i'ma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp type shit that b-low and ak'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a hoe wanna holler then you a playa if you hit them ends
And get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same hoe to wanna freak your friends
Cause I studied p-i, m-p, ology, but logically
Be learnin these hoes biology, obviously, well..."
until it sleeps,metallica,1996," Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my side So tear me open, pour me out!
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feel it once and now it stays
Now it stays So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps
So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you until it sleeps
I don't want it So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me
Till clean I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
