id do anything for love but i wont do that,meat loaf,1993," And I would do anything for love,
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love,
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact But I'll never forget the way you feel right now,
Oh no, no way.
And I would do anything for love,
Oh I would do anything for love,
Iwould do anything for love,
But I won't do that
No I won't do that Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love,
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that And some days, it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before
Or will again And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it That I would do anything for love
I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I wont do that I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that And somedays I pray for silence
And somedays I pray for soul
Somedays I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N Roll. And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
The one and only promise I can keep As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
And I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back But I'll never do it better then I do it with you
So long
So long
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no I won't do... I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of

Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold? I can do that!
Oh I can do that! Will you hold me sacred?
Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old? I can do that
Oh oh now i can do that Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home? Now I can do that
Oh now I can do that Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot! (HOT)?
Will you take me places I've never known? Now I can do that
Oh, oh now I can do that! After a while to forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that its time to move on I won't do that
I won't do that I know the territory
I've been around
It'll all turn to dust
And we'll all fall down
And sooner or later you'll be screwing around I won't do that!
No, I won't do that! Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that"

Signed, with a home tattoo
""Happy birthday to you"" was created for you Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces Ahh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real?
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry Who do you need?

i dont wanna fight,tina turner,1993," There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere
And we both know what
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending
I can't live this life I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me It seems to me lately
You look at me the wrong way
And I start to cry
Could it be that maybe
This crazy situation is the reason why I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
Tired of all these games Oh, baby don't you know
I don't wanna hurt no more
This time I'm walking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We have to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
Don't wanna hurt no more But, baby don't you know, know
I don't wanna hurt no more
Too much talking
Don't care now who's to blame

But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin' I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You said I know you're mister O.P.P man

Won't only see me man
You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark You try to act like something really big is missing

Swerve what you heard
Cause I ain't baling no hay
Ain't chopping no crop
But still growing every day Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Ill town
Drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns
Beat downs are found
Don't know me! Don't come around! Tippy tippy pause
Tippy tippy pause
Some start creepin' up, I eat 'em up
Their styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver name is Mook
I'm hittin' woodies in a hoody

For whatever that means And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling... a little peculiar. And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on? And I say:
Hey yeah yeaaah!
Hey yeah yeah.
I said hey

in the morning light
and the day had just begun... She opened up
her eyes and thought

it's a day for catching tan
just laying on the beach
and having fun

and the day is right
she's a hunter, you're the fox... The gentle voice
that talks to you
won't talk forever. It's a night for passion
but the morning
means goodbye... Beware of what is flashing
in her eyes

One last cry, before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you outta my mind this time
Stop living a lie I guess I'm down to my last cry, cry I was here, you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you, nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry, before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you outta my mind this time
Stop living a lie I know I've gotta be strong
'Cause round me life goes on and on and on
And on I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I had, my one last cry
One last cry, before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you outta my mind for the very last time
Been living a lie

bed of roses,bon jovi,1993," Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my hand
And some blonde gave me nightmares, I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead With an ironclad fist, I wake up and french kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
And the truth is, baby you're all that I need I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses Well I'm so far away
Each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night
To speak through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, baby blind love is true I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
Well I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died Now as you close your eyes, know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me to stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone but you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses"

cats in the cradle,ugly kid joe,1993," My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usually way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew he said,
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you"" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?""
""Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then You know we'll have a good time then""
Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play
Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today
I got a lot to do"" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away and he smiled and he said,
""You know,
I'm gonna be like him, yeah You know I'm gonna be like him"" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?""
""Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"" Well, he came from college just the other day, So much like a man I just had to say,
""I'm proud of you. Could you sit for a while?""
He shoo his head and he said with a smile,
""What I'd really like Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?""
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home, Son?""
""I don't know when
We'll get together then You know we'll have a good time then""
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

what about your friends,tlc,1993," What about your friends?
What about?
What about your friends?
What about, what about? Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say I supply creativity
To what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own? I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there with you through the thick and thin What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you
Yo, this is me, well is it me or can it be I'm a little too friendly So to speak hypothetically say I supply creativity
To what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you
People say I act a little funny, I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me, yeah, yeah
Even though I might seem easy, it don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down? Will they ever be around

Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know When you know the notes to sing, you can sing 'most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)

Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know, the deeper I go ""All is fair in love"", she said,
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do will end up coming back to you

And I believed it instead of remembering what my mama told me
Let my father mold me, then you tried to hold me
You remind me of what they said
This feeling inside, I can't explain
But my love is alive and I'm never gonna hide it again Daddy couldn't be all wrong

rain,madonna,1993," I feel it
It's coming Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain... When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time
To tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard
I know it's real
Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain... When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye
Could you see my tears...
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I wait for the light,
I'll wait for the sun, till I feel your Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say... never go away... Waiting is the hardest thing [It's strange]
I tell myself that if I believe in you [I feel like I've known you before]
In the dream of you [I want to understand you more]
With all my heart and all my soul [And more and more]
That by sheer force of will [When I'm with you]
I will raise you from the ground [I feel like a magical child]
And without a sound you'll appear [Everything strange]
And surrender to me [Everything wild]
To love Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your Rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
Feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain... I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain... You step out on the mountaintop

Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you

when she cries,restless heart,1993," The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams

Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through ()
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the FEARS SHE FEELS INSIDE
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes ()
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves

it was a good day,ice cube,1993," Break 'em
Just wakin' up in the mornin' gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog I got my grub on, but didn't pig out Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinkin' will I live another twenty-fo'
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggaz everyway like M.J I can't believe, today was a good day
(shit)
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven Seven even back do' Lil' Joe I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A Today was a good day
(shit)
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams No helicopter looking for a murder Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a pimp""
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I got to say it was a good day
(shit)
Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit
What the fuck I'm thinkin' about?"

Wait a minute guys.
Wait wait wait. You guys, we should not attack her, it sounds like it's
serious because we can't concentrate and get this right. So, let's deal with
the problem.
You see, I've been through this myself, and, let's talk.
And it goes a little something like this - hit it.
Mmm... Verse 1:
Baby girl (unfair but true)
Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (a fool)
Tears for fears (are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life
I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around Chorus:
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have Verse 2:
Fact of life (so sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love, can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time, to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come
I've seen time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around Chorus:
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
(Give it up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
Give it up turn it loose
Turnin' it loose, baby

somethin' real smooth
you can just ride to
tell me how you feel
here we go...
the day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
i was loced out kris kross shirts and khakis
lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a mac
see, the bell rang and i got my dash
fellin' good cause it was the last day of school and i passed
no moms trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
to celebrate the fact that i wasn't slippin'
the downtown scene was packed
people screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the mac
i says ""what i am is what i am is who i be""
and yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
cool, cause dissin' and no pay
they're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
and all that love keeps me and chris tight
long as we give some love back everything's alright.
now everything feels alright when i'm rollin' through my hood
and i see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
little kids try to be like me with the braids, the shades, some pants,
and some nikes, g
and yet more letters, and the letters sayin'
""i'm your number one fan could you write me back man?""
yesssss...
i try to pass 'em my autograph
i try to do as many as i can
now it feels good when i'm rollin' through my hood
ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
cause i'm down like four flat tires
just a little nappy headed kid from the proj.
showin' i can do right and not do wrong
rappers and the beejees comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the side
we only love those who love us back
right?
now people seem to think what i do is a blast
cause i'm always on the road and i'm makin' some cash
but they don't know
really know
the pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
early mornin' interviews then we step to school
step from school
back to interviews then it's on to other dues
so, warm it up chris
i said ""ya warm it up chris""
that's what i was born to do

Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground

three little pigs,"green jell""y",1993," Why don't you sit right back?
And I, I may tell you a tale
A tale of three little pigs
And a Big, Bad
Wolf
Well, the first little piggy, well, he was kinda hick
He spent most of his days just a dreamin' of the city And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood to become a star
But living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity And then one day, jammin' on some chords
Along came the wolf, knocking on his door
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in
Well, the second little piggy, well, he was kinda stoked
He spent most of his day just in ganja smokin' Huffin' and a puffin' down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech
He built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks Then one day he was cranking out Bob Marley
And along came the wolf on his big, bad Harley
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in
Well, the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star named Pig Nugent Earned his Masters Degree from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills And then one day came the old house smasher
The big, bad wolf, the little piggy slasher
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in
Well, the big bad wolf
Well, he huffed and he puffed, all that he could
And low and behold the little piggy's house stood ""It's made out of concrete"", the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned, as he pouted
So, they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
They sent out Rambo just as fast as they could Yo, wolf-face, I'm your worst nightmare
Your ass is mine
Well, the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
So, that's to end the story for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may
Hear a big wolf or little piggy say
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in
And the moral of the story is
A band with no talent can easily amuse
Idiots with a stupid, puppet show"

hey jealousy,gin blossoms,1993," Tell me do you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway I've got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad

If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone Tomorrow we can drive around this town

if i ever lose my faith in you,sting,1993," You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse but If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
Hey hey I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first If I ever lose my faith in you
(If I ever lose my faith in you)
There'd be nothing left for me to do
(There'd be nothing left for me to do)

cant get enough of your love,taylor dayne,1993," I've heard people say that
Too much of anything
Is not good for you baby
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me
Like it's ever, ever enough
It's just not enough My darling, I, can't get enough of your love babe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe Oh some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give the more I want
And baby that's no lie, oh no babe Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you
What kind of love is this
That you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet
All I know is every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing If I could make you see
And make you understand
Your love for me is all I need
and more than I can stand
Oh well babe How can I explain
All the things I feel
You've given me so much
You're so unreal, unreal, unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
What am I gonna do
Cause you've blown my mind
I get the same old feeling
Every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing SONGWRITERS

two steps behind,def leppard,1993,
the sign,ace of base,1994," Shock!
I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you
Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong But where do you belong
Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy
Under the pale moon Where I see a lot of stars
Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
And I am happy now
Living without you
I've left you I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
I saw the sign, I saw the sign I saw the sign

i swear,all4one,1994," I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes I'll never break your heart
And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear like a shadow that's by your side I'll be there
For better or worse
Till death do us part I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear
Ooo... I'll give you every thing I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when (and when) just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
Cause as the time turns the page My love won't age at all
And I swear (I swear) by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there (I'll be there)
I swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there) For better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear

the power of love,celine dion,1994," The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake 'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side 'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away 'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love The power of love
The power of love Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love The power of love As I look in your eyes The power of love"
hero,mariah carey,1994," There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth That a hero lies in you It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you"
stay i missed you,lisa loeb and nine stories,1994," You say I only hear what I want to
And you say I talk so all the time-so And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running or to
Anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no no no - bad So I turned the radio on I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
The lover's in love and the other's run away
The lover is crying cause the other won't stay
And some of us hover when we weep for the other who
was dying
Since the day they were born well
Well this is not that
I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown And I thought I'd live forever but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever but that won't take me anyhow
Or anywhere with you And you said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought ""hey I can leave, I can leave""
But now I know that I was wrong cause I missed you
Yeah I missed you You said ""you caught me cause you want me
And one day I'll let you go""
You try to give away a keeper or keep me cause you're know
you're
just too scared to lose And you say, ""stay"" You say I only hear what I want to."
breathe again,toni braxton,1994," If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again That I shall never breathe again
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinkin' about About the love that you make to me
And I can't get you out of my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away
And I can't stop carin' about About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the center of my life And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again
And I can't stop thinkin' about About the way my life would be
No, I can't stop thinkin' about How could your love be leavin' me And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I tried
And if you walk right out my life God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the rythm of my heart
No, I can't stop doin' without For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause I know I can't deny
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you
That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again
That I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again
breathe again..."
