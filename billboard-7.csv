the way you love me,faith hill,2001," If I could grant, you one wish
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss
Oooh, I love watching you
Baby
When you're driving me, crazy
Oooh, I love the way you,
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Oooh, to feel the way I, feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see, the way you love me
The way you love me
It's not right
It's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am, to know you
Oooh, I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Oooh, to feel the way I, feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see, the way you love me
Ohhh, the way you love me
You're the million reasons why
There's love reflecting in my eyes
Oooh, I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Oooh, to feel the way I, feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see, the way you love me
The way you love me
The way you love me
Oooh, the way you love me
The way you love me"
he loves u not,dream,2001," [Intro]
...head, all night long
You wanted me to love
Mustard on the beat, ho [Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can [Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up on your girl with my roof gone
I'ma pull up on your girl with my jewels on
Pull up on your girl with that heat on
She don't know if it's a Dolla or a Dream song
First I beat it from the back, she on top now
Used to wanna leave, but she not now
She used to wanna be with you, but nigga, not now
It's kinda funny how she put herself on lockdown
And now you talkin' that blah-blah-blah
I'm up here ballin' like la-la-la
Gave it to her, made her scream, ""Da-da-da""
And now you wanna act all rah-rah-rah rah-rah-rah [Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can [Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Girl, you should know that
I'ma fall asleep in it, popped a whole Xan
If you gettin' cold feet, I'll make the snow sand
I'ma rest in peace in it, pop a toe tag
Pull up on it in an Uber, that's how I maneuver
Turn this D into a D+ and I'm her tutor
Turn a B into a D cup, hallelujah
Got her clappin', yeah she booby-trappin' out at Hooter's
Treat the little lollipop like Lallapalooza
I'm the one to introduce her, kama sutra
Say she a cougar when it comes to Young Mula
12 gauge, girl, Tunechi 'bout to one-two ya [Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can [Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can"

i hope you dance,lee ann womack,2001," I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. I hope you dance... I hope you dance... I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider
Give the Heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone.) I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. Dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone.)"
south side,moby featuring gwen stefani,2001," See myself in the pouring home
See the light, come over now
I see myself in the pouring rain
I watch hope come over me Here we are now, going to the East side
I pick up my friends and we start to ride
Ride all night and we ride all day
Some may come, no but some may stay Here we are in the pouring home
I watch the light man fall the comb
I watch a light move across the screen
I watch the light come over me Here we are now going to the West side
Weapons in hand as we go for a ride
Some may come, no but some may stay
Watching out for a sunny day Where there's love and darkness
And my sidearm, hey, Elan, Elan Here we are now going to the North side
I look at my friends as they start to ride
Ride at night and we ride all day
Looking out for a sunny day Here we are now going to the South side
I pick up my friends and we hope we won't die
Ride at night, ride through Heaven and Hell
Come back, love and feel so well"
