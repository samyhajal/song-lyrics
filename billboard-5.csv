Those tears are for someone else
I hear your voice on the phone
I hear you feel so alone
My baby
Oh my baby
Please my baby

And truth was paramount
We were older then,
And we lived a life without any doubt

Don't cry
Not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry you'll always be loved

Of friends I had before

Your not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby

They get harder now

foolish games  you were meant for me,jewel,1997," I hear the clock, it's 6am
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and I've got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off all the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore
Cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know, that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken and more people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie but it just wasn't the same
Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad
Cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know, that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
BRIDGE
I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up, and then I turn the sheets down
And then I take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it will be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight
Cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
And I know, you love me
And soon i know you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Yeah, you were meant for me

ill be missing you,puff daddy featuring faith evans and 112,1997," Yeah, this right here goes out to everyone
that has lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out... Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they came to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream
In the future can't wait to see if you
Open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometimes, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath I know you're still livin' your life after death Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take What a bond to break
I'll be missing you It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you Somebody tell me why...
On that morning
When this life is over I know, I'll see your face Every night I pray (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)

i believe i can fly,r kelly,1997," I used to think that I could not go on

But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it

I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me Oh-oh, if I can see it
Then I can be it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it I believe I can fly

dont let go love,en vogue,1997," I'm so glad to see you
Now I have the chance to say
Our love's been growing freely
What must I do to make you stay Don't go I feel the time is right
'Cause my love for you has grown
Up until this very night
I had doubts your love was strong enough
To break me down
Now I'm caught up in this web
You've spun for me tonight Don't go It takes a gifted man
To release the love in me
So far you're the only man
Who has gone this far for me
It feels it's out of my hands
Can't think twice, it's much too right
This may be my only chance Don't go I've been such a fool
To have kept my love for you
Could have lost your love
Searching for the truth
Don't go nowhere, you know I care
Stay right here with me forever, baby Don't go Let's make sweet love tonight
I won't put up any fight
Your wish is my command
Lay me down upon my bed
And make me feel the heat
Of your body next to mine
I just have one demand Don't go You send chills down my spine
I surrendered all my love
You captured all my life
In just one night of ecstasy
You brought me to my knees
Your first bite was just to strong
You left a scar on me Don't go I've been such a fool
To have kept my love from you
Could have lost your love
Searching for the truth Don't go I'm so glad to see you
Now I have the chance to say
Our love's been growing freely
What must I do to make you stay Don't go"

I tried to fight it but the feelings just to strong  You make me wanna wanna 
You make me wanna  You make me wanna leave the one I'm with

bitch,meredith brooks,1997," I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved
To see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one I'm a bitch
I'm a lover
I'm a child
I'm a mother
I'm a sinner
I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell
I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing I'm a bitch
I'm a lover
I'm a child
I'm a mother
I'm a sinner
I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell
I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way (...) Just when you think
You've got me figured out

You know you wouldn't want it any other way I'm a bitch
I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt
When you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb
I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive

semicharmed life,third eye blind,1997," Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo... I'm packed and I'm holdin'
I'm smilin', she's livin', she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, comin' over you
Keep on smilin' what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you And I speak to you like the to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said... I want somethin' else, to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want somethin' else, I'm not listenin' when you say good-bye Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo... The sky was gold, it was rose
I was takin' sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smilin' in the pictures you would take
Doin' crystal meth, will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm, I bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
I said... How do I get back there, to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said... I want somethin' else, to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want somethin' else, I'm not listenin' when you say good-bye I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright And when the plane came in, she said she was crashin'
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive, those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress One
And you hold me, and we're broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heading off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not comin' down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now, locked down in a smile
But nothin' is alright, alright
And I want somethin' else, to get me through this life
Baby, I want somethin' else
Not listenin' when you say...
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...
The sky was gold, it was rose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
I was takin' sips of it through my nose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
And I wish I could get back there (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
Someplace back there, in the place we used to start (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)
I want somethin' else (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)"
barely breathing,duncan sheik,1997," I know what you're doing
I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye... Cause I am barely breathing
And I can't find the air
Don't know who I am kidding
Imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting
A fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price
The price that I would pay And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction? I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change? Cause I am barely breathing
And I can't find the air
I don't know who I'm kidding
Imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting
A fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price
The price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway...
I'm thinking it over anyway I've come to find
I may never know
Your changing mind
Is it friend or foe?
I rise above
Or sink below
With every time
You Come and go
Please don't come and go Cause I am barely breathing
And I can't find the air
I don't know who I'm kidding
Imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting
A fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price and you're worth the price
The price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway...
I'm thinking it over anyway...
And I know what you're doing
I see it all too clear"
the freshmen,the verve pipe,1997," When I was young I knew everything
She a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice,.no I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place Chorus:
For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept
Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen We've tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmen"
i want you,savage garden,1997," Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola I don't need to try to explain, I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball that
I need to, I want to
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look and then a smell perfume, it's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for Conversation has a time and place in the interaction of a lover
And a mate but the time of talkin using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat
Come stand a little bit closer Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out Anytime I need to see your face

In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola I don't need to try to explain I just hold on tight

To the arms and the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that I need to I want to Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out So can we find out Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you

4 seasons of loneliness,boyz ii men,1997," Oh yea oh oh oh
I long for the warmth of days gone by when you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you, no matter what I try When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same Remember the nights when we closed our eyes
And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time Anytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same This loneliness has crushed my heart
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness again In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same
Remember the warmth of days gone by"

where have all the cowboys gone,paula cole,1997," One two three four Oh you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone Why don't you stay the evening
Kick back and watch the T.V.
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Ohh I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee my sweet I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone
Where is my Marlboro Man
Where is his shiny gun
Where is my lonely ranger

all by myself,celine dion,1997," When I was young
I never needed anyone

Those days are gone
Living alone

When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home All by myself

And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure All by myself

its all coming back to me now,celine dion,1997," There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right

Baby, Baby, Baby
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this

building a mystery,sarah mclachlan,1997," You come out at night
That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
You strut your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith that died
Before Jesus came
You're building a mystery You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
You wear sandals in the snow
And a smile that won't wash away
Can you look out the window
Without your shadow getting in the way? You're so beautiful
With an edge and charm
And so careful
When I'm in your arms Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully You woke up screaming aloud
A prayer from your secret god
But you feed off our fears
And hold back your tears, oh
You give us a tantrum
And a know it all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin You're so beautiful
A beautiful fucked-up man
You're setting up your
Razor-wire shrine Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in

i love you always forever,donna lewis,1997," Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless sumkmer nights Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you

your woman,white town,1997," Just tell me what you've got to say to me I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now, I know your heart, I know your mind You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way
Well, I guess what you say is true I could never be the right kind of girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
When I saw my best friend yesterday She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming handsome man Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes?
I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way? Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never spend my life with a man like you

And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peek then you must be drinking
And smokin'
Pretending not to locin' but you're brokin'
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and Little Jimmy got life
And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it wasfunny
But who's the dummy
Cuz, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother can never by replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya I know I can't trust ya
Coz my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dustas
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryina preach

I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Coz it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin' Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Someone's gotta run a little faster cuz we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
And if everybody's a sinner then everybody could ba a winner
No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the times somebody up there still love us I'm a scuffle and struggle till I'm breathless and weak
I just strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin'

You need to loosen up
And live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin' For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that
You busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Jones's taking advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to what's right when
There's something of all that we desire
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous
I know time seems right
And the problems seem endless
But at times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you fell you're out the game then you need to get back in it Coz nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pitty and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side I'll see you when you get there

It's up to you to make it big

last night,az yet,1997," Last night you were so into it
You told me secrets that you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and yet, oh, so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my mind slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight in your soul You felt incredible, I started to explode I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Sunlight, red, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes And I'm so, I'm so in love
Last night, I was inside of you Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you, baby

Listen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock
His name is Jay and he's on his way
To be the best DJ in the US of A J-a-y are the letters of his name
Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, 1 2 3
Jam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C. He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better cause he knows he has to
In '84 he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master We're live as can be but we're not singing the blues
We got to tell all y'all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not 5, not 4, not 3, just 2
2 MC's who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Beacause it's about time for a brand new group
Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay"" Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high

smile,scarface featuring 2pac and johnny p,1997," Intro: 2Pac There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
that's gon' make it hard to smile in the future.
But through whatever you see,
through all the rain and the pain,
you gotta keep your sense of humor.
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit.
Remember that.
Mmm, yeah.
Keep ya head up.Yeah. Verse One: 2Pac Our lifestyles be close captioned
addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
or the repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now Chours: Johnny P, 2Pac Smiiiiiile for me, won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smiiiile (smile), smile for me
(What cha lookin' all sad for? Nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smiiiiiile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smiiiiile
(And the next generation) Verse Two: Scarface Now as I open up my story
with the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, and takin' a gig
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile Chorus (without 2pac) Verse Three: 2Pac Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds
of unaswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitenturies the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga (Scarface talking) And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
may the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that the families made
shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
Be there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
Can we say a prayer for our homie 'Pac? Smile (Smile for me)
(All ya need to do is smile)
(Woooo smile for me)
(Come on smile for me)"

naked eye,luscious jackson,1997," Wearing nothing is devine
Naked is a state of mind
I take things off to clear my head
To say the things I haven't said
Live inside the elements
The earth and sky are my best friends
Water is the evidence
That washes me from end to end With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all if I said it all
I could see It's not a choice I tried to make
It's not a thought I couldn't take
Something told me it was time
To give you yours and leave me mine
My vision started to be clear
I watched the sunlight coming near
I knew the day I knew the night
I knew i could regain my sight And it feels alright
And it feels alright With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all if I said it all
I could see With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all if I said it all
I could see Last night I came into your home
To break some ice and throw some stones
I asked if we could be alone
I had some troubles of my own
Knew I had to say goodbye
To all the old things held inside
If I let the moment fly
I knew they'd all be magnified And it feels alright
And it feels alright Came around after dark
You are nothing but a lark
Know I snuck in like a narc
I knew I had to leave my mark
Wanted to be satisfied
I tried to be dignified
Wearing nothing is divine
Naked is a state of mind And it feels alright
And it feels alright With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all if I said it all
I could see With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all if I said it all
I could see It feels alright (x9)"

i shot the sheriff,warren g,1997," --Chorus--
I shot the sheriff
--Chorus-- Verse One: I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields
we keep makin war shields
streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist
and it aint nobody like my down ass hommie
and tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
they do crime and it attracts cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in --Chorus-- Verse Two: They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
you know who
the boys in blue
there they go with they assumpitons
slaverys over let us have somethin'
why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
my profession is music
your profession is protection with gats
then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in --Chorus-- Verse Three: I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
and leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
they harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
the hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
cuz I'm gonna work for life
so he can see another day
a hommies a hommie
a fake is a snake
straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake

you should be mine dont waste your time,brian mcknight featuring mase,1997," Mase:
Mase, and Brian McKnight, Bad Boy
C'mon
We don't stop, we rock we rock
Yo
I hit you with the sound that the world can't take
Can't sit out the gig playing 2.8
Real studded jewel funded
Got to love it
First rap cat with the R&B; budget
Every day on the TV me and PD
Girl's so pretty, make their man break the CD
Why y'all forever roudy
I be out here somewhere in Maui
Till I go back to Cali
Brian:
Can't understand how he can treat you the that way he does
Give me the chance to show you baby, your better off with me
(OOh, so will you let me try
I wanna make you smile)
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
(I'll never let you go
I'll always be around)
And you should be mine
(He don't love you right
Don't waste your time
Don't waste your time)
He don't treat you like he should (no baby)
You should be mine
You should be mine, baby
Why can't you see
You should be happy

rest of your life

Yo!
What the deal honey
Insecure feel funny
I know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money
Plus I know you're like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays
When you shopping did you shop for 2
Uh!
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back
Treat you like you're all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night
Just to save a fight
Or say he's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in you life
Even though he gave you ice gown that will make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
Then he give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
'cause Mase ain't the player with the PhD
Brian:
Girl come into my world
I love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries, no more
Girl open the door
And don't waste your time
'cause you should be mine
He don't love you right (ooh baby)
Don't waste your time (don't waste your time)
He don't treat you like he should (ooh)
You should be mine (should be mine, baby baby)
He don't love you right
Don't waste your time (don't waste your time)

dont cry for me argentina,madonna,1997," It won't be easy
You think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done You won't believe me
All you will see
Is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines At sixes and sevens with you I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun So I chose freedom
Running around Trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desire
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promise to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much
There is nothing more I could think of to say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word is true"

go the distance,michael bolton,1997," I have often dreamed, of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, ""this is where I'm meant to be."" I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong
I know every mile, will be worth my while
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong. Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through. And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms
I will search the world, I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms"

There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man
Are you insane See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me

That his love is all in me See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me
He couldn't make it through the day
Ain't that a shame Well maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good

Try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future

And the stars spell out your name And it seems to me you lived your life

i dont want to wait,paula cole,1998," So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father? I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry? He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry? You look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the love in every eye
I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?"
hows it going to be,third eye blind,1998," I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
I wanna get out of this
I wonder is there anything
I'm gonna miss I wonder how it's gonna to be
When you don't know me
How's it gonna be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it gonna be
When there's no one there to talk to
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it gonna be
How's it gonna be Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in
tha swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me I wonder how's it gonna be
When it goes down
How's it gonna be
When you're not around
How's it gonna be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it gonna be How's it gonna be
When you don't know me anymore
And how's it gonn be? Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion... oblivion
How's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
How's it going to be
How's it going to be How's it going to be"

See, it's rare that you find people like us

Out there doing what I'm doing
Or try to do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh?! Come on! I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, ""Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?""
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it... My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying ""You, can't, front""
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, ""Give it to me now, baby"" My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it... My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way

Just one more night with you

Living in the memory of our song I'd give my all for your love tonight Baby can you feel me

Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't want to say yes, afraid of your reaction I knew it was wrong for feeling this way

Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night I had to decide, I was thinkin' I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night I should make a move but I won't
And then you probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down but not the first night We was chillin' watching your TV
I felt it was comin' the closer that you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And some how in one night, discover I love you Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how we're caryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch is telling me it's getting to late, I'm thinkin' I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night I should make a move but I won't
I know you probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down but not the first night If you want me, you got to know me
And if you want my love, you gotta wait my love
Baby, that's the way it's got to be
Get to know me, so we can do this, ooh I should

Knowin' if I do

show me love,robyn,1998," There's a notebook on the table,
You can take it to the store
So you won't forget the groceries anymore There's a rifle in the cabinet
That I used to fight a war
But to this day I don't know what I was fighting for
Been fighting for... Will you
Show me love as we get older
And I'm falling at your feet?
After 30 years of service
And one to fit our need.
Show me love as we grow colder;
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need. There's a blanket on the sofa
That I use to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four. There's a record we keep turning
That reminds us of our youth -
But there's still nothing as beautiful as you. (As we grow colder
Love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
Hearts will never need) Because your hand
Belongs in my hand,
Belongs in your hand;
Belongs with...
With me! (Blanket on the sofa
That I use to keep you warm
There's a record we keep turning
That I used to turn you on) Will you
Show me love as we get older
And I'm falling at your feet?
After 30 years of service
And one to fit our need.
Show me love as we grow colder;
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need."

deja vu uptown baby,lord tariq and peter gunz,1998," New York to the heart but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam Hoe, damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat Splat like Deja Vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Don P, Mo' with pistol
Just 'cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should mis doubt Keep 'em near da fifties and hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich but bitch, I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope Friends call me Gunz, sons call me Trife
'Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee, Peter knows how to eat her and beat her Niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex
'Cause I push a Lex and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex' and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin' to flex
Like Dex, nigga, God rest your soul
But when you're playin' cards for Gunz, it ain't time to fold, hoe New York niggaz got crazy game
But outta town niggaz is all the same
Brooklyn niggaz get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef, they ain't scared to shoot Harlem niggaz know how to play
Mack the 600, gettin' crazy pay
Niggaz outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the glock, runnin' up in yo' spot But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from? Uptown, baby, uptown, baby
We gets down, baby, up for the crown, baby
We gets down, baby, up for the crown, baby Yo, the RM 80 is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
Thinking shit's gravy, stop me? Maybe I'm livin' life lawless, makin' big investments
On them 8 class flawless and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Ricarro, two quarters of my life
Walkin' roads, type, narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by Puffin' high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin' high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the Pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo Keep my toast closer than most niggaz keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggaz rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin' deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded, have your whole block flooded With the Bronx, it's a warnin', stormin' guns out
From, 'Dusk Til Dawn' and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin' about
And put a eye on yo' lip, nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
'Cause you'se a small-time nigga, 'bout a half an ounce now New York niggaz got crazy game
But outta town niggaz is all the same
Brooklyn niggaz get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef, they ain't scared to shoot Harlem niggaz know how to play
Mack the 600, gettin' crazy pay
Niggaz outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the glock, runnin' up in yo' spot But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on

Go outside

Whenever you need me

Whenever I'm gone too long If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain

And the night's
As empty for me as for you
If you feel
You can't wait till morning
Kiss the rain

Hello... Do you miss me
I hear you say you do
but not the way I'm missing you
What's new How's the weather
Is it stormy where you are
You sound so close but it feels like you're so far
Oh would it mean anything
If you knew
What I'm left imagining
In my mind
In my mind
Would you go
Would you go
Kiss the rain
As you fall
Over me Think of me
Think of me
Think of me
Only me
Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips
Feel hungry and tempted
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind We're under the same sky
And the night's
As empty for me as for you
If you feel you can't wait till morning
